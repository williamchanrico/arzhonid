          <h2 id="first">Three Days of Happiness</h2>
          <p>
            &ldquo;How much money would your life be worth?&rdquo; <br />
            I was once asked a question like that. <br />
            Yes, I believe it was part of a lesson on morals in fourth grade.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most of the students, after much debate, settled on somewhere
            between tens of millions of yen and hundreds of millions. <br />
            Of course, some students were firm in their belief that money
            couldn&rsquo;t buy life. <br />
            <br />
            You&rsquo;d probably get the same sort of responses from adults.
            <br />
            Personally, if you asked me before that day I really sold my own
            lifespan, I would say my life was worth around 200 or 300 million.
            <br />
            <br />
            I figured that if I sold ten or twenty years of lifespan for a few
            tens of millions of yen, it would be a clever way to ensure my
            remaining life was easy. <br />
            Between a happy sixty years and a not-so-much eighty, I was sure I
            wanted the former. <br />
            <br />
            That all got turned around when I saw my results. <br />
            It seemed my life didn&rsquo;t even make it to a million yen. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            One July when I was twenty, I was tight on money. <br />
            <br />
            I wasn&rsquo;t eating anything but white rice and miso soup. <br />
            In the past few days, I had collapsed three times while working as a
            waiter, so I knew I needed to eat more nutritious. <br />
            <br />
            I considered what I could get some money off of, but all I came up
            with was furniture, a bunch of CDs, and a large collection of books.
            <br />
            <br />
            The stuff was all mostly old and used, and not worth much, but I
            figured it might be enough for a month of food. <br />
            So I cleaned things up to look as new as possible, and went down to
            my usual bookstore and music shop to sell it. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The old man at the bookstore, seeing me bringing in piles of books
            to sell, worriedly asked &ldquo;What on earth happened?&rdquo;
            <br />
            I was surprised, since he was usually a very blunt man. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Paper doesn&rsquo;t make for a good meal,&rdquo; I said, and
            the old man seemed to understand and sympathize. <br />
            But he wouldn&rsquo;t pay me any extra. Then again, he was poor,
            too. <br />
            <br />
            After getting my money, I went to leave, and the man called out to
            stop me. <br />
            &ldquo;Hey, I wanna talk to you about something.&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;, I said, hoping for some pity money, and he said:
            <br />
            &ldquo;You wanna sell some of your lifespan?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Thinking he had just gone senile, I decided to entertain the old
            man&rsquo;s story. <br />
            <br />
            In short, this is what he told me. <br />
            There&rsquo;s a building not too far from here with a shop
            that&rsquo;ll buy your lifespan. <br />
            You can sell your time and your health there too, but lifespan
            fetches the best price. <br />
            <br />
            The man drew a map and wrote a phone number with his shaky hands,
            but I was sure it was only a fantasy of the old man&rsquo;s to make
            himself feel better. <br />
            I really felt sorry for him. Must be fearing that death was
            approaching. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            However, when I next went to the CD shop, I was told the very same
            thing I had been told at the bookstore. <br />
            What&rsquo;s more, this time it was from a man in his late twenties,
            so it was hard to say he was senile too. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hey, just between us, bud&#8230;&rdquo;, he said to me.
            <br />
            &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a place where you can sell your lifespan
            near here!&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            He claimed to have sold some lifespan himself. <br />
            &ldquo;How much did you get for it?&rdquo; I asked bemusedly.
            &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you, dude!&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I felt like the whole world was teasing me. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Yet in the end, I went to that building I was told of. <br />
            My CDs, books, and furniture hadn&rsquo;t made me much money at all.
            <br />
            <br />
            I certainly didn&rsquo;t believe the story about selling your
            lifespan. <br />
            Rather, I considered the possibility that the old man and the
            younger man were using some kind of metaphor to allude to a
            lucrative job. <br />
            Something like &ldquo;at the risk of shortening your lifespan, you
            can make a million yen in a month!&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I climbed the dimly-lit stairs and opened the door. <br />
            I met eyes with a woman at a counter, and she asked me: <br />
            &ldquo;Your time? Your health? Or your lifespan?&rdquo; <br />
            And I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Frazzled from the series of events, I said &ldquo;lifespan,&rdquo;
            tired of thinking. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Give us about two hours,&rdquo; the woman said, already
            clacking away on a computer keyboard. <br />
            <br />
            Hey, who are you to waste people&rsquo;s time like that? <br />
            I looked around the store. <br />
            It was empty in a way hard to describe - like an optometrist&rsquo;s
            with no glasses, or jewelry shop with no jewelry. <br />
            <br />
            But who knows? Maybe people&rsquo;s lifespans and health and time
            were on display, and I just couldn&rsquo;t see it. <br />
            Geez. How long were they going to keep up this unfunny joke? <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I went out to a plaza and lit a cigarette, savoring my last one.
            <br />
            I really need to quit soon, I thought. <br />
            It&rsquo;s a waste of money, and no good for my health. <br />
            <br />
            An old man was feeding pigeons nearby, and shamefully enough, it
            made me feel hungry. <br />
            I was this close to pecking at the ground along with the pigeons.
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope my lifespan sells for a lot, I thought. <br />
            <br />
            After killing time at the train station, I returned to the shop
            early and slept on the sofa, waiting for my assessment. <br />
            My name was called after about twenty minutes. <br />
            Strange, since I never actually gave my name. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            When I saw the assessment, I gave a weird shriek. <br />
            <br />
            10,000 yen for one year? Thirty years remaining? <br />
            <br />
            Book Off would give more reasonable prices than that. <br />
            Did I get the prices for a turtle or something by mistake? <br />
            But my name was on there, no doubt about it. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What kind of standards are you basing this on?&rdquo;, I
            asked, showing the woman the form. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Several factors,&rdquo; she answered with a slight sigh.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Degree of happiness, actualization, contribution. Those sorts
            of things.&rdquo; <br />
            She must have been tired of always getting the same question. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The woman told me the details of the system. <br />
            She really didn&rsquo;t want to, but I was rather insistent. <br />
            <br />
            What shocked me the most was that 10,000 yen was the lowest possible
            price you could fetch for a year of lifespan. <br />
            <br />
            Which is to say, my life was all but worthless. <br />
            I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy, wouldn&rsquo;t make anyone else happy,
            wouldn&rsquo;t accomplish anything, and wouldn&rsquo;t experience
            anything of worth. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;If you have no objections, sign here, please,&rdquo; the
            woman said as if trying to wake herself up from boredom. <br />
            But if anyone could have no objections with this, I think the mental
            hospital would be a better place for them. <br />
            <br />
            But by then, I was numb, and getting used to getting a raw deal on
            selling my things. Desperate, I told her this: <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep three months and sell the rest.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I left the shop with an envelope containing 300,000 yen. <br />
            <br />
            I felt a kind of convulsive chuckle welling up in me. <br />
            The sad thing was, I somehow knew already just how worthless my
            lifespan would be. <br />
            <br />
            But I didn&rsquo;t want to think about it anymore. <br />
            I bought a ton of beer on the way home, and walked down the roads
            drinking it that night. <br />
            <br />
            It had been a long time since I&rsquo;d had alcohol. <br />
            Thus, I had absolutely no tolerance for it, and threw up for two
            hours when I got home. <br />
            <br />
            It was a disastrous start to my remaining three months. <br />
            <br />
            #2ch<br />
            I guess if someone wants to sell their lifespan, their time
            isn&rsquo;t worth anything anyway, which is why they figure they can
            waste it&#8230; <br />
            <br />
            #2ch<br />
            I think about this sort of stuff myself sometimes&#8230; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I fell asleep around four in the morning, but for once, I had a
            happy dream. <br />
            I dreamt of a lazy summer day back when I was a grade schooler.
            <br />
            When I went in my parents&rsquo; car with a friend to go camping.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ahh, I cried as I slept. <br />
            I was saved from my mercilessly happy dreams by the sound of the
            doorbell. <br />
            When I continued to ignore it, a voice called my name. <br />
            <br />
            I opened the door to find an unfamiliar girl standing there. <br />
            I was initially happy - a conditioned response to seeing a girl at
            my door - but when I looked at her face, I remembered. <br />
            <br />
            She was the woman who assessed my lifespan. <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miyagi. I&rsquo;ll be your observer from today
            forth.&rdquo; <br />
            The woman, Miyagi, lightly bowed toward me. <br />
            <br />
            Observer&#8230; Yeah, I guess she did say something about that.
            <br />
            As I tried to remember yesterday through my hangover, I ran to the
            toilet to throw up again. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Leaving the bathroom disheartened, I saw my observer standing at the
            door. <br />
            Did she want to hear my puke in all its glory? <br />
            After gargling and drinking three cups of water, I returned to bed
            and lied down. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;While I explained it yesterday,&rdquo; Miyagi said, standing
            beside me. <br />
            &ldquo;Since your lifespan has been reduced to less than a year, I
            will be observing you from today forth.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Can this wait until later?&rdquo;, I said with a glare at
            Miyagi. <br />
            &ldquo;Understood. Later, then,&rdquo; she said, and went to sit in
            the corner of the room. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi fixated her gaze on me. <br />
            I&rsquo;m sure people who&rsquo;ve had similar experiences know, but
            this can really interfere with your routine. <br />
            There&rsquo;s a lot you can&rsquo;t do when someone&rsquo;s
            watching, you know? <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Yes, she told me yesterday that customers who had a year or less
            left were assigned an observer. <br />
            <br />
            According to Miyagi&rsquo;s explanation, once customers were down to
            half a year left, they often fell into despair and were liable to
            cause trouble. <br />
            So an observer needed to stop them in advance. <br />
            <br />
            If I were to cause serious trouble to others, my observer would
            apparently call into HQ and have my lifespan depleted. <br />
            They don&rsquo;t want any Travis Bickles. <br />
            <br />
            However, for the final three days, the observer leaves so you can
            fully enjoy your own time. <br />
            It was found that statistically, people wouldn&rsquo;t do anything
            bad by then. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            By that evening, my nausea and headache had gone away. <br />
            I was finally able to think about things clearly. <br />
            <br />
            Yesterday, I had impulsively sold off the majority of my lifespan,
            yet even I was surprised how little I regretted it. <br />
            In fact, I thought it was good I only left three months, because I
            didn&rsquo;t want to be observed for that long. <br />
            Maybe three days would have been even better? <br />
            <br />
            Well. There was no point in moping about my lack of worth now.
            <br />
            The issue was what I would do now, with my three months. <br />
            <br />
            I took out a sheet of paper and a pen, and created a list of things
            I wanted to do. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            My to-do list was something like this. <br />
            <br />
            - Meet and thank my childhood friend <br />
            <br />
            - Have a good chat with my best friend <br />
            <br />
            - Spend as much time as possible with family <br />
            <br />
            - Write final letters to all my friends <br />
            <br />
            - Don&rsquo;t go to university at all <br />
            <br />
            - Don&rsquo;t go to my part-time job either <br />
            <br />
            Pretty ordinary ideas all around. <br />
            If someone else had written it for me, I feel it would turn out
            similar. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I noticed Miyagi standing behind me - for who knows how long -
            looking at the list I wrote. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I would suggest against that,&rdquo; she said, pointing at
            the first item. <br />
            The &ldquo;Meet and thank my childhood friend&rdquo; one. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, I asked Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            &#8230;I suppose I&rsquo;ll talk about my childhood friend. <br />
            We were friends since we were four, and she&rsquo;d even appeared in
            my dream. <br />
            We went everywhere together until she changed schools. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            When I started middle school, I was unfamiliar with everything.
            <br />
            I was isolated from the rest of the class, but she was the only one
            who talked to me every day and asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
            wrong?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Even after we went our separate ways, she would always come to mind
            in troubling times. <br />
            <br />
            Without her, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here today. <br />
            Well, I guess that wouldn&rsquo;t have been a huge loss. <br />
            <br />
            At any rate, I was very grateful to her. <br />
            We hadn&rsquo;t communicated at all in the past few years, but if
            anything happened to her, I told myself I would come running. <br />
            I wanted to repay her somehow - it didn&rsquo;t matter how. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;About your childhood friend&#8230;&rdquo; Miyagi informed me.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;She gave birth to a child at seventeen, then dropped out of
            high school. <br />
            She was married at eighteen, but then divorced at nineteen. <br />
            She&rsquo;s currently twenty and raising a child alone. <br />
            And incidentally, in two years time, she will hang herself. <br />
            <br />
            If you go to meet her now, she will likely only beg you for money.
            <br />
            She scarcely remembers you at all.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            How can I describe my reaction? <br />
            Well, I felt deeply wounded. It hit me hard. <br />
            My most precious memories were being trampled. <br />
            <br />
            It&rsquo;s pitiful, but even at twenty, at my core I was still pure,
            na&iuml;ve, and sensitive - essentially, I had never matured from
            childhood. <br />
            Whenever things changed, or came to an end, I couldn&rsquo;t bear
            it, even now. <br />
            I was an adult man, but as weak as a canary. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            And yet I tried my best to not be bothered. <br />
            &ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; I said, lighting a cigarette. <br />
            <br />
            After smoking three or so, my head started hurting badly. <br />
            But I kept smoking, if only to help forget. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi returned to the corner of the room. <br />
            Her hand flew smoothly through her notebook, writing things down.
            <br />
            <br />
            I noticed the sun was setting. <br />
            Looking down at the list I wrote, I drew a line through the item for
            my childhood friend. <br />
            <br />
            After looking over the list again, I took the phone in hand and
            slowly pushed the buttons. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What is it? It&rsquo;s unusual to get a call from you.&rdquo;
            <br />
            It had been much too long since I&rsquo;d heard my mother&rsquo;s
            voice. <br />
            I was too busy with work and study to have any time to call. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Sorry that it&rsquo;s so sudden, but I was wondering if I
            could come home?&rdquo; <br />
            That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d planned to ask her. <br />
            Then I could enjoy my last days peacefully in the embrace of my
            family&rsquo;s love. <br />
            But before I could say anything, my mother went on talking non-stop.
            <br />
            <br />
            She talked to me about my younger brother. <br />
            My mother loved to talk about him at any opportunity. <br />
            <br />
            The thing was, my brother was pretty famous. <br />
            He was practically born to play baseball, and was pitching at
            Koshien in his first year. <br />
            He&rsquo;s always showing up on TV, too. That&rsquo;s my little
            brother. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Of course, my mother would talk about all the things he was
            constantly up to. <br />
            This time, she brought up the girlfriend he&rsquo;d brought home.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a beautiful girl,&rdquo; my mother told me
            roughly twenty times. <br />
            &ldquo;So beautiful I can hardly believe we&rsquo;re fellow humans!
            And her personality&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
            She went on as if they had already produced her a grandchild. <br />
            She didn&rsquo;t seem at all willing to listen to me. <br />
            <br />
            My desire to return home to my parents was gradually withering.
            <br />
            Apparently, this wonderful girlfriend of my brother&rsquo;s was
            always being invited over for dinner. <br />
            Just imagining me being in the middle of that made me want to
            shrivel up and die. <br />
            <br />
            I hung up as soon as I found a decent opportunity. I gave up on
            returning home. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I determined that it was no use doing anything today. <br />
            Even doing something I liked would only be a distraction. <br />
            So I decided I&rsquo;d try again tomorrow. <br />
            <br />
            Of course, there was still someone in the corner of the room who
            couldn&rsquo;t be helping matters. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly fine if you just pretend I&rsquo;m not
            here,&rdquo; Miyagi said, perceiving my feelings. <br />
            But whatever she might have said, it wouldn&rsquo;t keep me from
            being bothered. <br />
            I have to admit I&rsquo;m a pretty nervous guy. <br />
            <br />
            When you&rsquo;re being watched by a girl your age, your every
            action goes bonkers. <br />
            I noticed I was touching my hair. Entirely too self-conscious.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            For a while, I tried reading Finnegans Wake, the most difficult book
            I owned. <br />
            Naturally, none of what I was reading actually got into my head.
            <br />
            What was I doing with my remaining three months? <br />
            <br />
            Tired of reading, I went to a nearby supermarket to buy whiskey and
            ice. <br />
            Miyagi bought some sweet rolls and other stuff for herself. <br />
            I felt like I was having a happy hallucination. <br />
            <br />
            To be honest, I had long dreamt of such a thing. <br />
            Living together with a girl, going to the store still in our
            loungewear, and buying food and things together. <br />
            <br />
            I felt envious whenever I saw others partaking in such an act.
            <br />
            So even if she was there to observe, I enjoyed going for some
            late-night shopping with a young girl. <br />
            An empty happiness, perhaps? Don&rsquo;t judge, it was real enough
            for me. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I returned home and savored every drop of whiskey, finally feeling
            good again. <br />
            Alcohol is really great in times like these. <br />
            <br />
            I approached Miyagi writing in her notebook in the corner.
            &ldquo;Want some?&rdquo;, I invited. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m on duty.&rdquo; Miyagi refused
            without even looking up. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you writing there?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;A record of actions. Yours.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Ah. I&rsquo;m drunk right now.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yes, I can see that.&rdquo; Miyagi nodded begrudgingly.
            <br />
            I really must be a pain, huh. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Once totally drunk, I felt like the protagonist of a tragedy. <br />
            But then I became suddenly positive, and was filled with a
            mysterious energy. <br />
            <br />
            I turned to Miyagi and proclaimed: <br />
            &ldquo;With my 300,000 yen, I&rsquo;m gonna change something!&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Miyagi said, not entirely interested. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a helluva lot, but it&rsquo;s my life. <br />
            I&rsquo;ll make it 300,000 yen that&rsquo;s worth more than 300
            million!&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I thought I sounded pretty cool, myself. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            But Miyagi was apathetic. &ldquo;That is what everyone says.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Whaddya mean?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Everyone speaks of extremes when death is nearing. <br />
            &#8230;But please, Mr. Kusunoki. Think of it this way.&rdquo; <br />
            Miyagi stared at me with emotionless eyes. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What can a man who would accomplish nothing in thirty years
            change in a mere three months?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Won&rsquo;t know &lsquo;til we try,&rdquo; I replied,
            though I knew she was right on the money. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Realizing something, I asked Miyagi. <br />
            &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d know all the stuff that
            would&rsquo;ve happened in those thirty years of my life?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;More or less, yes. Though it&rsquo;s all of no importance
            now.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yeah, well it&rsquo;s important to me. Spit it out.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Miyagi said. <br />
            &ldquo;First of all, I shall say that in the thirty years you sold,
            no one ever loves you.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a damn shame,&rdquo; I said, as if it
            wasn&rsquo;t my business. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You are unable to love anyone else as well. <br />
            And indeed, that makes you unlovable by those around you. <br />
            You grow further and further apart from others, and you grow weary
            of the world.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi glanced toward me. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&quot;But maybe something good will still happen.&rdquo;
            <br />
            These words let you survive until fifty, until ultimately, you die
            alone and with nothing, grieving that this world was not for
            you.&ldquo; <br />
            <br />
            &quot;That&rsquo;s a damn shame too,&rdquo; I mechanically repeated.
            <br />
            But deep inside, I was unmistakably hurt. <br />
            It was all too easy to see happening. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi went on, telling me I&rsquo;d get in a bike accident at age
            forty. <br />
            The accident would take half my face and make me unable to walk.
            <br />
            <br />
            It wasn&rsquo;t nice to hear about, but on the other hand, I could
            be considered lucky for dying before I had to experience it. <br />
            <br />
            It was true - for fifty years, I would live a meaningless life,
            prolonged only by a false hope. <br />
            Once I knew for sure that nothing good would happen, I could instead
            die without regret. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I turned on the TV to distract myself. <br />
            The show appeared to be a sports feature. <br />
            Just as I was about to change the channel, my worst fear was
            realized: my younger brother&rsquo;s face and name came up on
            screen. <br />
            <br />
            I reflexively threw a glass at the screen. <br />
            The TV fell over onto the ground, and shards of the thrown glass
            went flying. <br />
            <br />
            I swung around to look at Miyagi. <br />
            She was watching me closely, clearly on her guard. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my younger brother,&rdquo; I attempted to say
            cheerfully. <br />
            Instead, it made me appear more like a grinning maniac. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Do you not particularly care for your brother?&rdquo;,
            Miyagi said with disdain. <br />
            &ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; I confirmed. <br />
            I heard banging on the wall from the neighboring room. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            As I cleaned up the broken glass, my drunkenness cleared as if to
            aid me. <br />
            Once the alcohol fully went, I knew I would be in the worst state of
            mind. <br />
            <br />
            So I called a certain person. <br />
            This, too, was the worst of choices. <br />
            I&rsquo;m a professional at taking my life in the worst possible
            directions. <br />
            <br />
            I called my best friend from high school. <br />
            We hadn&rsquo;t talked in a few months, but when I said &ldquo;Want
            to meet up?&rdquo;, he gladly replied &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right
            there!&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I felt like I was saved, if only a little. <br />
            So there is still someone who cares about me. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            This is the most pathetic part of all, but I had a bit of a motive
            for meeting my friend. <br />
            <br />
            This Miyagi girl may not have any courtesy, but the way she acts is
            cute. <br />
            I mean, she&rsquo;s always right behind me. <br />
            Of course, that&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s my observer. <br />
            <br />
            But while I was walking around the supermarket, I had a thought.
            <br />
            I wonder if we look like a couple to everyone else? <br />
            I mean, what else would we look like? <br />
            <br />
            I was hoping for my friend to have that misunderstanding. <br />
            I wanted to boast about how I&rsquo;d brought home a cute girl.
            <br />
            What a completely embarrassing motive, right? <br />
            But for me, it was urgent. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            We came to our table at the restaurant, and Miyagi sat beside me.
            <br />
            I was impatiently waiting for my friend to arrive. <br />
            <br />
            I looked at the time. I was probably way too early. <br />
            I decided to have some coffee while I waited. <br />
            <br />
            When the waitress came by, I gave my order and turned to Miyagi.
            &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            She looked displeased. <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Um. Did I not tell you earlier?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo;, I replied. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You are the only one who can see me. <br />
            Or hear me. No one else will notice my presence in the least.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi tackled the waitress in the side, and there was indeed no
            response. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I looked up and saw the waitress&rsquo;s face. <br />
            She looked at me like I was nuts. Which I was. <br />
            <br />
            Now I&rsquo;ve done it. <br />
            My face was red for a while out of sheer embarrassment. <br />
            <br />
            This meant, of course, that even my meager dream of boasting about a
            girl to my friend was not to be. <br />
            I was layers upon layers of miserable. <br />
            If only I could sell misery instead of my lifespan, or my health, or
            my time. <br />
            <br />
            Just as I was going to leave, my friend appeared right on cue.
            <br />
            We shared in the joy of our reunion. <br />
            But my half of it was despair. I didn&rsquo;t even care anymore.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            We were discontent souls in high school. <br />
            We would always be sitting in McDonald&rsquo;s, spending hours
            complaining to each other. <br />
            <br />
            Perhaps all we wanted to say to each other then was &ldquo;I just
            wanna be happy.&rdquo; <br />
            But we were scared to say it, so we spent hours cursing instead.
            <br />
            <br />
            Yet while my friend was still complaining years later, something
            about him had fundamentally changed since then. <br />
            <br />
            They weren&rsquo;t the unrealistic, irrational complaints that
            missed the point from back in high school. <br />
            They were pragmatic, reasonable complaints about things like his job
            and girlfriend. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore. <br />
            My friend was starting to brag more and more, and Miyagi was
            whispering things to me from beside. <br />
            <br />
            I hated being talked to by both at once. I felt like my head was
            going to explode. <br />
            <br />
            I was pushed to my limit. <br />
            Even under normal circumstances, I wouldn&rsquo;t have managed.
            <br />
            <br />
            Without thinking, I shouted &ldquo;SHUT UP!&rdquo; at Miyagi. <br />
            The restaurant fell silent. After a few seconds, I went completely
            pale. <br />
            <br />
            Before my friend could say anything, I left my part of the bill and
            got out of my seat. <br />
            I was starting to look more psychotic by the minute. <br />
            No wonder I only got 300,000 for this. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I walked home. My drunkenness cleared up, and despite my poor
            condition, my eyes weren&rsquo;t weary. <br />
            <br />
            Since I wasn&rsquo;t sleepy at all, I thought I&rsquo;d watch TV,
            but then I remembered I&rsquo;d broken it with the glass. <br />
            The sound seemed to still work, though, so I decided to think of it
            as a big, clunky radio. <br />
            <br />
            I opened a can of beer and drank it with some Pretz. <br />
            Miyagi seemed to be writing about me as usual. <br />
            Writing about my idiotic stunt at the restaurant, surely. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hey, sorry for shouting at you earlier,&rdquo; I said. <br />
            &ldquo;Just like you said. I should&rsquo;ve just come up with a lie
            and gotten out of there.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Miyagi replied without looking. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Wanna drink when you&rsquo;re done writing that?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You want me to drink?&rdquo;, she asked. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m lonely.&rdquo; I spoke the truth. <br />
            &ldquo;Apologies, but I&rsquo;m on the job. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
            She turned me down. <br />
            You should&rsquo;ve just said that first then, geez. <br />
            <br />
            Dawn came and I heard the chirping of birds. <br />
            Miyagi appeared to be observing me following a cycle of sleeping one
            minute, awake for five. <br />
            She&rsquo;s gotta be tough. Definitely not something I could do.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I woke up when the sun was setting. <br />
            <br />
            It may be hard to believe, but I used to be pretty diligent. <br />
            I would always go to bed at 12 and wake up at 6. <br />
            Waking up with the sunrise was refreshing to me. <br />
            <br />
            I looked toward the corner and saw Miyagi there as always. <br />
            She had seemingly taken a shower at some point, as she smelled of
            soap when I passed her. <br />
            <br />
            It was my room, yet the area around Miyagi felt like a completely
            different dimension. <br />
            <br />
            I looked over the list, and decided that I would write to my friends
            today. <br />
            I bought stationery at a nearby shop and picked up a fountain pen.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I realized I hadn&rsquo;t written a letter in a long time. <br />
            When was the last time I wrote a serious letter, in fact? <br />
            I searched my memory. Perhaps it was that summer in sixth grade.
            <br />
            <br />
            That summer, our class buried a time capsule. <br />
            The round, silver capsule contained treasures from our time and
            letters to our future selves. <br />
            Everyone was very earnest about their letters. It was surprisingly
            fun. <br />
            <br />
            Our teacher said we&rsquo;d dig it up when we turned twenty, but I
            had yet to hear anything about it. <br />
            It could have been I was the only one who wasn&rsquo;t contacted,
            but more than likely, they just forgot. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            That led me to a thought. If no one&rsquo;s dug it up, I would go
            dig up the time capsule myself. <br />
            Such a nostalgic, romantic notion steeped in sentimentality was just
            what I was looking for. <br />
            <br />
            When night fell, I took the train to the elementary school. <br />
            I borrowed a shovel from the shed, went behind the gym, and started
            digging. <br />
            <br />
            I thought it would be easy to find, but I just couldn&rsquo;t
            remember where we buried it. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi sat by and watched absent-mindedly as I kept digging holes.
            <br />
            It was a pretty strange sight. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I finally found the time capsule after three hours of digging.
            <br />
            By then, both my hands were blistered, my whole body sweaty, and my
            shoes muddy. <br />
            <br />
            I went under a streetlight and opened the capsule. <br />
            I had only wanted to take my own letter, but after all my effort, I
            decided I might as well look at all of them. <br />
            <br />
            I opened the letters of classmates who I didn&rsquo;t remember, not
            even their faces. <br />
            I had completely forgotten until just then that at the end of the
            letter, there was a column that said: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your best
            friend?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            You can probably guess where this is going, can&rsquo;t you? <br />
            There wasn&rsquo;t a single person who put my name there. <br />
            <br />
            So I see, I nodded to myself. <br />
            Even in good old elementary school, this was how it was. <br />
            <br />
            But there was at least one good thing. <br />
            My childhood friend, while she didn&rsquo;t name me as her
            &ldquo;best friend,&rdquo; did mention me in her letter. <br />
            Of course, calling that a good thing is pretty sad. <br />
            <br />
            Taking out my own letter and my childhood friend&rsquo;s, I buried
            the time capsule back where it had been. <br />
            <br />
            I recall that as I left, Miyagi stood where the capsule was buried
            and stomped the ground to make it even. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The last train had left hours ago. <br />
            I sprawled out on hard station chairs and waited for the morning
            train. <br />
            It was oddly light and there were lots of bugs, making it a terrible
            environment to get to sleep in. <br />
            <br />
            Meanwhile, Miyagi seemed totally fine. <br />
            She took out a sketchbook and drew a sketch of the premises. <br />
            I fell asleep wondering if that was part of her job. <br />
            <br />
            I woke up a few hours before the first train, went outside, and
            bought some iced coffee from a vending machine. <br />
            My body was aching from sleeping in such a weird place. <br />
            <br />
            The sky was still dim. <br />
            When I went back inside, I saw Miyagi stretching. <br />
            I felt like I had finally seen a human side to her. <br />
            I was somewhat pleased. Ah, so even she needs to stretch&#8230;
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            While I felt this, a strange emotion budded in me. <br />
            <br />
            Maybe it was having three months left to live. <br />
            Maybe it was the repeating despair. <br />
            Maybe it was the continuing stress, fatigue, and pain. <br />
            <br />
            Maybe I was still sleepy, or maybe I really did like this Miyagi
            girl. <br />
            <br />
            Well, it didn&rsquo;t matter. At any rate, I had a sudden impulse to
            do something mean to Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I approached Miyagi and asked. &ldquo;Hey, miss observer?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;, Miyagi said, lifting her head. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;If I were to get violent with you, about how long would it
            take before HQ or whatever killed me?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            She wasn&rsquo;t particularly surprised. She just looked at me with
            serene eyes and answered &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take more than an
            hour.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;So I&rsquo;d have a bunch of minutes to act freely?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            She looked away from me and said &ldquo;Nobody said anything like
            that.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Silence persisted for a while. <br />
            Oddly, Miyagi didn&rsquo;t try to run away. She just stared down at
            her lap. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Must be a dangerous job.&rdquo; <br />
            I sat down two seats away from Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            She continued to look away. <br />
            &ldquo;So long as you understand.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            My prior impulse was promptly put to rest. <br />
            When I saw Miyagi&rsquo;s resigned eyes, it went so far as to make
            me sad too. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of guys like me, aren&rsquo;t there?
            <br />
            On the verge of death, they go nuts and take out their anger on
            their observer.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi gently shook her head. <br />
            &ldquo;As a matter of fact, you are an easy case. <br />
            There are many who go to much further extremes.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Why would a young girl like you take such a dangerous
            job?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi began telling me the answer bit by bit. <br />
            <br />
            She told me she had a debt, which had originated with her mother.
            <br />
            Despite not having such a great life, her mother took out loans to
            buy a longer lifespan. <br />
            But she got sick and quickly died, leaving Miyagi to pay the debt.
            <br />
            A refreshingly disgusting story. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I would have been able to pay the debt by selling my entire
            lifespan. <br />
            I was very close to going ahead with it, but just as I was about to
            give up, I was told about the observer job. <br />
            <br />
            It&rsquo;s a difficult job, but it does pay very well. <br />
            At this rate, I believe I can pay the full amount by the time
            I&rsquo;m fifty.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            By the time she&rsquo;s fifty? <br />
            This only made me feel worse. <br />
            <br />
            She talked about it like it was her salvation. <br />
            But even if I didn&rsquo;t do anything to her, she couldn&rsquo;t
            put up with guys like me for decades more, could she? <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Maybe you should just sell off a life like that,&rdquo; I
            said. <br />
            &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not even a guarantee you&rsquo;ll make it to
            fifty, is there?&rdquo; <br />
            She gave a worried look. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yes, many of the people I&rsquo;ve observed for this job have
            tried to kill me. <br />
            But&#8230; You see, it&rsquo;s not that simple. <br />
            Perhaps something good will happen someday.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I know a guy who died at fifty saying that to himself but
            getting nothing out of it.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Miyagi said with a small smirk. <br />
            I was unreasonably pleased that she smiled at my joke. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I got on the first train, and surrounded by suits and uniforms, I
            talked to Miyagi, unconcerned about those around me. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;No one may have chosen me as their &quot;best friend&rdquo;
            for the time capsule, but hey, at least my childhood friend
            mentioned me in her letter.&ldquo; <br />
            <br />
            Of course, no one could see Miyagi, so I appeared to be talking to
            myself. What a creepy guy. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi looked worried. <br />
            &quot;Um. Everyone is watching. They&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re
            weird&#8230; or already do.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Let them think that. Because I am. <br />
            &#8230;So I was thinking it over at the station, and I realized that
            no matter how much she&rsquo;s changed, that friend of mine is my
            entire life.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I want to meet her and talk to her one last time. <br />
            And as thanks for giving me life, I want to give her the 300,000 yen
            from selling it. <br />
            You might be opposed, but I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s my
            lifespan, and my money.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;If you insist, I have no objections. <br />
            But please stop talking to me here in the train. It&rsquo;s
            extremely embarrassing.&rdquo; <br />
            Despite her words, Miyagi oddly seemed to be enjoying herself.
            <br />
            <br />
            Rather than going home, I went straight to the city. <br />
            I filled my stomach with toast, eggs, and coffee, took a deep
            breath, and called my childhood friend. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;We can meet at night,&rdquo; my friend told me. <br />
            That was convenient. I had to make preparations of my own. <br />
            <br />
            I took Miyagi&rsquo;s hand and walked along swinging it back and
            forth. <br />
            Everyone else saw me doing it all alone, but I was having too much
            fun to care. <br />
            Miyagi looked concerned, but I kept pulling her along. <br />
            <br />
            First, I went to the salon and made a reservation for two hours
            later. <br />
            Then I went to a shop to buy clothes and shoes, changing there.
            <br />
            I hadn&rsquo;t bought any new clothes in years. <br />
            <br />
            With my new clothes and haircut, I felt like I was someone else.
            Miyagi had the same thought. <br />
            &ldquo;You almost seem like an entirely different person.&rdquo;
            <br />
            I was honestly glad. See, I&rsquo;m not a bad guy! <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I had time before our meeting, so I asked Miyagi to do a rehearsal
            of meeting with my friend. <br />
            <br />
            I entered the restaurant I went to yesterday and began. <br />
            I turned to Miyagi, who sat in front of me, and smiled. <br />
            &ldquo;Well, Miyagi? Do I look good?&rdquo; <br />
            To an observer (who wasn&rsquo;t this observer), I was grinning at a
            wall. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi answered while munching on her sandwich. <br />
            &ldquo;Hmm, your smile is a little stiff. <br />
            Your mimetic muscles must be weak from not smiling much.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Huh. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to work them out until
            tonight.&rdquo; <br />
            I repeatedly went between a smile and a neutral expression. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;You are rather interesting.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yeah. Charming, aren&rsquo;t I? Be careful not to fall for
            me.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I will be. But you do have your ups and downs.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            We were having a pretty good time, as a matter of fact. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            It was about eight hours between calling my friend and meeting her,
            but it felt like twenty-seven. <br />
            I was checking my watch almost every five seconds. <br />
            <br />
            I practiced with Miyagi up to the last minute. <br />
            We did trial and error in the corner of the cafe to determine how to
            give her a good impression. <br />
            <br />
            &#8230;And then, finally, the time came for our meeting. <br />
            I was thrown off by her changed appearance and tone, but I saw her
            smile and behavior hadn&rsquo;t changed. <br />
            That alone made me truly glad I called her. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Long time no see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you been
            well?&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing fine. And you?&rdquo;, I replied. <br />
            But that someone with three months to live was &ldquo;doing
            fine&rdquo; was laughable. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether it was my appearance, my money, or what, my friend seemed
            pleased with me. <br />
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really changed,&rdquo; she said, fawning over
            me. <br />
            <br />
            It really felt like things were going to go great. <br />
            I had practiced and had the benefit of knowing the future, so I
            succeeded in giving her a good impression. <br />
            <br />
            But I guess I can&rsquo;t be satisfied until I make a complete mess
            of everything. <br />
            <br />
            Interrupting my friend as she told me about her situation, I started
            talking about how I sold my lifespan. <br />
            I told her &ldquo;Um, you see, I only have three months to
            live&rdquo; in a way that invited her sympathy. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I suppose I believed in my heart that my dear friend would take me
            seriously, show deep sympathy, and console me. <br />
            <br />
            But not five minutes into my story, she was clearly getting bored.
            <br />
            She&rsquo;d just go &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;, looking at me like I was
            stupid. <br />
            <br />
            Of course, it was all my fault. I had made the mistake. <br />
            No one would believe a sudden story about a shop that deals in
            lifespan and observers this and that, especially not out of me.
            <br />
            I&rsquo;m glad she didn&rsquo;t just burst out laughing, at least.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hey, excuse me,&rdquo; she said, standing up. I thought she
            was going to the bathroom.<br />
            Just as she left, both our orders arrived. <br />
            I was desperate to continue my story. <br />
            <br />
            But she didn&rsquo;t come back. <br />
            I waited until the food was cold, and she didn&rsquo;t come back.
            <br />
            I had messed it all up again. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I ate my cold pasta slowly. <br />
            After a while, Miyagi sat across from me and started eating up my
            friend&rsquo;s pasta. <br />
            &ldquo;Quite tasty even if it&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; she said. <br />
            I didn&rsquo;t say anything. <br />
            <br />
            I left the restaurant and went to the bridge by the station. <br />
            Then I took out the envelope of 300,000 yen I was going to give my
            friend. <br />
            I walked along distributing the money to passersby, bill by bill.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You should stop this,&rdquo; Miyagi said. <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bothering anyone, am I?&rdquo;, I replied.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once people realized I was giving them money, they either gave a
            weak thanks or were dubious. <br />
            Many turned it down, and others asked for more. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The 300,000 yen was gone in no time. <br />
            I even took money out of my own wallet. <br />
            <br />
            I must have wanted people to care about me. <br />
            I wanted someone to ask, &ldquo;Did something happen?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Once I&rsquo;d distributed 330,000 yen, I stood right in the middle
            of the street. <br />
            People walking by looked at me uncomfortably. <br />
            <br />
            I didn&rsquo;t have money to pay a taxi, so I slept on a bench in
            the shade of a building. <br />
            There was a streetlight switching on and off right above me. <br />
            Miyagi slept on a bench as well. What an awful thing to do to a
            girl. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You can go home, okay?&rdquo; <br />
            She shook her head at me. <br />
            &ldquo;If I did that, I feel you would commit suicide.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Until I fell asleep, I gazed at the stars above. <br />
            <br />
            I had gotten more opportunities to look at the stars. The July moon
            was very pretty.<br />
            Perhaps it was the same in May and June, and I&rsquo;d simply not
            noticed. <br />
            <br />
            Before I fell asleep, I had a habit of thinking up landscapes in my
            head. <br />
            I would think about the kind of world I wanted to live in. <br />
            <br />
            I&rsquo;d done this since I was five years old. <br />
            Perhaps this childish practice was why I couldn&rsquo;t get
            accustomed to this world. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I woke up around six and walked back to my apartment. <br />
            There was a market on the edge of town, busy even in early morning.
            <br />
            <br />
            I finally reached the apartment after walking about four hours.
            <br />
            After all that I&rsquo;d been doing, my limbs were screaming. <br />
            I guess I can&rsquo;t just live a peaceful life, can I. <br />
            <br />
            I took a shower, changed clothes, and slept again. <br />
            Bed wouldn&rsquo;t betray me. I love bed. <br />
            <br />
            Even Miyagi seemed to be quite tired. <br />
            She took a shower and sat in the corner, half-asleep and not doing
            much observing. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            On the desk were my half-written letters. <br />
            But continuing them just felt absurd. <br />
            No one cared about anything I had to say. <br />
            <br />
            There was no one I wanted to see, and that left me with little else
            to do. <br />
            I had even my blown my chance at extravagance thanks to yesterday.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything else you&rsquo;d like to
            do?&rdquo;, Miyagi asked, trying to encourage me. <br />
            &ldquo;That you wanted to do, but kept yourself from doing.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            I put some serious thought into that, but found there wasn&rsquo;t
            much I liked at all. <br />
            Had I really been living happily until now? Doing what? <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            My old hobbies of reading and music appreciation were just to keep
            living. <br />
            I used music and books to make a compromise with life. <br />
            <br />
            While I had only three months left, I didn&rsquo;t want to do
            anything with them. <br />
            I had faintly realized it already, but there was nothing I lived
            for. <br />
            I was living almost solely to fantasize before I went to sleep.
            <br />
            <br />
            My observer said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if it&rsquo;s something
            meaningless. <br />
            Some of the people I&rsquo;ve observed, when down to two months,
            spend all their time sitting in the backs of moving trucks looking
            up at the sky.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Sounds peaceful,&rdquo; I laughed. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best to walk around outside when you want to
            think,&rdquo; Miyagi added. <br />
            &ldquo;Put on your favorite clothes and we&rsquo;ll go
            outside.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Well, that&rsquo;s nice of you. <br />
            It appeared this girl was gradually getting kinder to me. <br />
            Then again, perhaps since an observer is stuck being with someone,
            she&rsquo;s merely going along with it. <br />
            <br />
            I took Miyagi&rsquo;s advice and walked around outside. <br />
            The sunlight was strong that day. My hair felt like it was burning.
            <br />
            I soon got thirsty and bought cola from a vending machine. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I muttered. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;No, it&rsquo;s really stupid. <br />
            But I just remembered one thing I like.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Please, tell me.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I love vending machines.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Ah. &#8230;What about them do you like?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hmm. I don&rsquo;t know if I can say for sure myself. <br />
            But as a kid, I really wanted to be a vending machine when I grew
            up.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi looked at my blankly. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Um. Just checking, but by vending machine, you mean the
            machines which sell coffee, cola, and the like?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yeah. But more than that. Yaki onigiri, takoyaki, ice cream,
            hamburgers, corn dogs, french fries, corned beef sandwiches, cup
            noodles&#8230; <br />
            Vending machines offer all manner of things. <br />
            Japan is the land of vending machines. They originated here,
            too.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hmm&#8230; So it&rsquo;s a hobby of yours.&rdquo; Miyagi
            seemed to follow. <br />
            <br />
            It was a really stupid hobby. It was a hobby even plainer than train
            fanaticism. <br />
            The symbol of a stupid, worthless life, I thought. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;But I think I do understand.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;My burning desire to become a vending machine?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;No, that I don&rsquo;t think I can ever understand. <br />
            But vending machines are always there. <br />
            So long as you provide money, they will always offer warmth. <br />
            They offer more than the sum of their products. <br />
            They offer a clear function, with invariance and permanence.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            I was moved by her mini-speech. <br />
            &ldquo;Wow. You said what I wanted to say a lot better than I
            could.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said happily. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            This began my daily routine of going around to vending machines.
            <br />
            <br />
            I got on my bike and drove down country roads. <br />
            When I saw a vending machine, I&rsquo;d buy something and take a
            picture of it with a cheap camera. <br />
            I had no intention of developing the photos, but I did it anyway.
            <br />
            <br />
            I repeated this futile action for many days. <br />
            I knew that even when it came to a hobby as dumb as this, there were
            people far more serious about it than me, and I could never compete
            with them. <br />
            <br />
            But I wholeheartedly did not care. I felt like I was alive. <br />
            <br />
            It was difficult riding tandem on my Cub 110, so Miyagi sat on the
            back, and we visited many places. <br />
            I had finally found something I wanted to do, the weather was nice,
            and my life was suddenly peaceful. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I sat down in an empty lot and started smoking. <br />
            Miyagi drew in her sketchbook beside me. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Is it okay if you don&rsquo;t do your job?&rdquo;, I asked.
            <br />
            Miyagi&rsquo;s hand stopped and she looked at me. <br />
            &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;ll do anything bad right
            now,&rdquo; she said. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I said. I went over to
            Miyagi and watched her fill the paper with lines. <br />
            Huh, so this is how you draw, I thought. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re not so great, though,&rdquo; I teased her.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Which is why I&rsquo;m practicing,&rdquo; Miyagi said
            proudly. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Show me what you&rsquo;ve drawn,&rdquo; I asked. <br />
            She suddenly closed her sketchbook and put it in her bag. <br />
            &ldquo;We should be moving on now,&rdquo; she said, hurrying me
            along. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            One day, when I woke up and looked to the corner of the room, I saw
            an unfamiliar man sitting there. <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Where&rsquo;s the usual girl?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;On holiday,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m filling in
            today.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            So even observers get holidays. <br />
            &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I said, looking the man over. <br />
            He was a shady man who reminded me of a street vendor. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Your lifespan sold for the lowest possible price,
            huh?&rdquo;, he said, bluntly ridiculing me. &ldquo;Wow, never
            thought there&rsquo;d be such a guy.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Great, isn&rsquo;t it? Want me to teach you how it&rsquo;s
            done?&rdquo;, I casually replied, and the man was slightly
            surprised. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;You&rsquo;re pretty cocky, huh?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;No, I was very hurt by that comment. I&rsquo;m just
            bluffing.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            The man seemed pleased with me. <br />
            &ldquo;Maybe guys like you aren&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; he laughed.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Having a man as my observer helped me relax considerably. <br />
            <br />
            The man noticed this and said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t calm down when a
            girl&rsquo;s around, huh? <br />
            Gotta look good in front of her. I feel ya.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yeah, I can calm down around you. After all, I don&rsquo;t
            care what you think.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I said this as I read Peanuts, which I had been too embarrassed to
            read in front of Miyagi. <br />
            To be honest, I really love Snoopy. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Guess so. &#8230;Hey, by the way, what&rsquo;d you use your
            money for?&rdquo;, the man said, chuckling. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I walked down the road giving it out bill by bill,&rdquo; I
            answered. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Bill by bill?&rdquo;, the man said, suspicious. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yep. Thirty 10,000 yen bills to thirty people. <br />
            I meant to give it all to someone in particular, but I changed my
            mind.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            The man burst into uproarious laughter. <br />
            And then he asked me something. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hey, you - did you seriously believe it when they said your
            lifespan was worth 300,000 yen?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;, I asked the man. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I mean exactly what I said. <br />
            Your lifespan&rsquo;s 300,000 yen? Did you really think that?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Well&#8230; yeah, I thought that was pretty low at
            first.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            The man laughed, banging the wall. I was getting uncomfortable.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Right, right. Well, I don&rsquo;t want to say anything,
            but&#8230; well, next time you see that girl, you ask her. <br />
            &quot;Was my lifespan really worth 300,000 yen?&rdquo;&ldquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The next morning, Miyagi came to my apartment, and I asked her what
            the man had told me to. <br />
            <br />
            &quot;Of course it is,&rdquo; she answered. <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say, but your worth simply isn&rsquo;t
            very much.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; I said. Miyagi seemed to notice something and
            asked, &ldquo;Did my substitute tell you something?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;He just told me to check that with you, that&rsquo;s
            all.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Yes, well, 300,000 yen is 300,000 yen.&rdquo; <br />
            She continued to feign ignorance. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I thought you were embezzling me at first.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi looked toward me, her eyes widening slightly. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I thought maybe it was worth 30 or 300 million, and you were
            taking a cut of it for yourself. <br />
            &#8230;But somehow, I couldn&rsquo;t believe that. <br />
            I thought I was just making a fundamental mistake. <br />
            I pondered that all night, until I realized. <br />
            <br />
            &#8230;I was mistaken from the very beginning. <br />
            Why did I believe that 10,000 yen for a year was the lowest possible
            price? <br />
            Why did I believe that normal lifespans should sell for tens and
            hundreds of millions? <br />
            <br />
            Maybe I was basing too much on my prior opinions. <br />
            I was applying my own common sense to the situation. <br />
            I should have been more flexible in my thinking.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I took a breath, and said: <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What made you want to give a whole 300,000 yen to someone
            you&rsquo;d never even seen before?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi appeared to understand what I meant, but said &ldquo;I
            don&rsquo;t have the faintest idea what you&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;
            <br />
            As usual, she sat in the corner staring at her lap. <br />
            <br />
            I sat in the opposite corner of the room and sat down the same way
            she did. <br />
            Miyagi smiled at this. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You can feign ignorance, that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; I said.
            &ldquo;But I just want to say thanks.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi shook her head. <br />
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. If I kept this job up, I&rsquo;d surely
            die before I paid the debt. <br />
            Even if I paid it and was free, I&rsquo;m not promised a good life
            afterward. <br />
            So I decided it would be better to do this.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;So how much am I worth, really?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Thirty yen,&rdquo; Miyagi whispered. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;A three-minute phone call,&rdquo; I laughed. <br />
            &ldquo;Sorry for using your 300,000 yen like that.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Indeed. I do wish you would have used it more for
            yourself.&rdquo; <br />
            Miyagi&rsquo;s wording felt angry, but her voice was gentle. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;But I certainly understand how you feel. <br />
            I gave you that 300,000 yen for a similar reason, after all. <br />
            I felt lonely, sad, hollow, and desperate. <br />
            So I went and did something unreasonably altruistic.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not upset or disappointed. To me, you are
            someone who is worth 30 or 300 million yen.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Stop it, that&rsquo;s such a weird consolation,&rdquo; I
            smiled. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Miyagi said with a serious look.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re too kind to me, I&rsquo;ll just get
            miserable. <br />
            I know that you&rsquo;re a nice girl already, so you don&rsquo;t
            need to go any further.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite annoying. Just be quiet and let me cheer
            you up.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Never been told that before.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Besides, this isn&rsquo;t consolation or kindness. <br />
            I&rsquo;m just telling you what I&rsquo;ve been wanting to
            say.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;To you, though, it must be trifling,&rdquo; Miyagi
            said, hanging her head in embarrassment. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I was glad that you were willing to talk to me. <br />
            Even moreso that you would talk to me in front of others and not
            even care. <br />
            <br />
            Because I&rsquo;ve always been invisible. Being ignored was part of
            my job. <br />
            So even little things like talking with me, eating with me, going
            out shopping - it was like a dream. <br />
            You were the first person to always treat me like I was
            &quot;there,&rdquo; no matter the time or the situation.&ldquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &quot;I can keep doing that if you like,&rdquo; I joked, and Miyagi
            gave a sweet smile. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I would love that. Since&#8230; I do love you.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Though loving someone who&rsquo;s soon to go away won&rsquo;t help
            anything. <br />
            She smiled sadly. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            It was then when I finally found an objective for my meaningless
            last months. <br />
            Miyagi&rsquo;s words brought about an incredible change within me.
            <br />
            <br />
            I decided, no matter what it took, I would pay Miyagi&rsquo;s debt
            in full. <br />
            <br />
            Yes, me, whose life wasn&rsquo;t even worth a hundred yen. <br />
            I guess I just didn&rsquo;t know my place. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            My life took a sudden turn. <br />
            I kept telling myself: Think, think, think. <br />
            How can I pay her debt in the remaining months? <br />
            How can I ensure she&rsquo;ll live peacefully? <br />
            <br />
            I knew that trying the lottery or gambling wasn&rsquo;t the way to
            go. <br />
            Those with money always win at gambling in the end, and the jackpot
            always goes to people who don&rsquo;t want to change a thing. <br />
            <br />
            I followed Miyagi&rsquo;s past advice and walked all around town.
            <br />
            I did that the next day, the day after, and the day after that.
            <br />
            I hoped for an answer to come rolling at my feet. <br />
            <br />
            I didn&rsquo;t eat much of anything during that time. <br />
            Because I knew that at a certain level of hunger, my head cleared
            up. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi seemed to worry for me. <br />
            &ldquo;Please, let&rsquo;s go vending machine visiting again,&rdquo;
            she told me repeatedly. <br />
            &ldquo;I actually quite like looking at them now, too. And I like
            clinging to your back on the bike.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            But I kept walking, and kept thinking. <br />
            Before I knew it, I was at the bookstore I often went to. <br />
            Yearning to see the old man&rsquo;s face, I went inside. <br />
            <br />
            The old man was listening to baseball and reading, as usual. <br />
            I had wanted to tell him about the events of the past days, but I
            thought he might feel guilty about it, so I acted like I never went
            to that shop he told me about. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            We had a casual conversation for about twenty minutes. <br />
            Neither of us really engaged the other, but it put me at ease
            somehow. <br />
            <br />
            As I left, I asked the old man something. <br />
            &ldquo;How do you think you can improve your own value?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            The man turned down the volume on the radio. <br />
            &ldquo;Hmm. Guess you just have to be reliable about doing things.
            <br />
            That&rsquo;s not something I can do, though. <br />
            I guess you just see things to do in front of you, and you get good
            at staying on top of them. <br />
            <br />
            &#8230;But there&rsquo;s something more important than that. <br />
            And that&rsquo;s not to trust the advice of somebody like me. <br />
            You see somebody who never achieved anything talking about success,
            they&rsquo;re just blind to their own failings.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            After leaving the bookstore, I walked down to the CD shop. <br />
            I told the clerk there the same lie I told the old man. <br />
            <br />
            After talking a little bit about the CDs I&rsquo;d been listening
            to, I asked: <br />
            &ldquo;How do you think you can accomplish things in a short
            time?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Guess you gotta depend on others, dude,&rdquo; he said.
            <br />
            &ldquo;'Cause a single guy can&rsquo;t do that much on his own,
            yeah? <br />
            Which means you gotta have someone else&rsquo;s help. <br />
            I don&rsquo;t have a whole lotta faith in my own ability, tell you
            the truth.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            It was advice I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should take to heart or not.
            <br />
            Outside, it had started raining heavily, as it does in the summer.
            <br />
            As I went to leave the store, the clerk lent me an umbrella. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I dunno what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on, but if you wanna
            accomplish something, don&rsquo;t forget about your health,&rdquo;
            he said. <br />
            <br />
            I put up the umbrella and walked with Miyagi. <br />
            It was a small umbrella, so our shoulders got soaking wet. <br />
            <br />
            People watching, meanwhile, saw an idiot holding an umbrella in a
            stupid way. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; Miyagi laughed. <br />
            &ldquo;What do you like?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Despite how comical it looks to others, you letting your
            shoulder get wet is a very kind gesture.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said bashfully. <br />
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a shameless shy man,&rdquo; Miyagi said, poking
            my shoulder. <br />
            <br />
            People passing by looked at me oddly. <br />
            I dared to keep talking with Miyagi, however. <br />
            By this point, I enjoyed being treated like a weirdo, and I knew
            that Miyagi enjoyed it. <br />
            The more comical I looked, the more it would make Miyagi smile.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            While taking shelter under a shop overhang, I saw a familiar face: a
            guy in my department at school who I greeted every day. <br />
            When he saw me, he approached me angrily. <br />
            &ldquo;Where the hell have you been?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I put my hand on Miyagi&rsquo;s shoulder and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
            been going around with this girl. Her name&rsquo;s Miyagi.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Not funny,&rdquo; he said displeased. <br />
            &ldquo;I always knew it, but man, you really are deranged, Kusunoki.
            <br />
            That&rsquo;s what you get for hiding in your husk instead of
            interacting with people.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop you from thinking that. <br />
            If I were in your position, I&rsquo;d probably say the same thing.
            <br />
            But Miyagi&rsquo;s here, all right. And she&rsquo;s real
            cute.&rdquo; <br />
            I burst into laughter, and he left, fed up with me. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The rain started to clear up; it was only a brief shower. <br />
            A rainbow faintly appeared in the sky. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Um&#8230; Thank you for that,&rdquo; Miyagi said, leaning on
            my shoulder. <br />
            <br />
            Be &ldquo;reliable,&rdquo; huh? <br />
            I remembered the advice of the old man at the bookstore. <br />
            <br />
            Thinking about it, there was something I could do. <br />
            I had been set on the idea of paying her debt, but perhaps just
            getting myself into these situations could help her a fair bit.
            <br />
            <br />
            That&rsquo;s right. I can give her happiness in a very real way.
            <br />
            It was right in front of me all this time - so why didn&rsquo;t I do
            it? <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            We got on the bus and went to the lake. <br />
            Most would raise their eyebrows when they heard what I did there.
            <br />
            <br />
            Knowing that people thought I was on my own, I went to ride on one
            of the duck boats. <br />
            The clerk gave me a look as if to say &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;, so I
            turned to Miyagi who he couldn&rsquo;t see and said &ldquo;Okay,
            let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; <br />
            There was some amount of terror in his eyes. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at how funny it was the entire
            time we were on the boat. <br />
            &ldquo;I mean, an adult male, alone, riding a duck boat?&rdquo;
            <br />
            &ldquo;Feels like I&rsquo;ve crossed the line,&rdquo; I said. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            After the one-man duck boat, I did the one-man Ferris wheel, one-man
            merry-go-round, one-man aquarium visit, one-man see-saw, one-man
            pool, one-man toast at a bar&#8230; <br />
            Nearly anything that would be embarrassing to do alone, I did it.
            <br />
            <br />
            And whatever I was doing, I would actively talk to Miyagi. <br />
            I would frequently call her name and walk holding hands with her.
            <br />
            <br />
            I gradually became an infamous celebrity. <br />
            There were quite a few people who&rsquo;d point at laugh when they
            saw me. <br />
            <br />
            But luckily, since I was always so happy about what I did, there
            were just as many who enjoyed seeing me. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            People began to think of my actions as a performance. <br />
            Some even praised me as a pantomime showing off his skills. <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, people would show up and ask &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
            Miyagi doing?&rdquo; <br />
            Yes, it was gradual, but they began to accept Miyagi&rsquo;s
            existence. <br />
            <br />
            Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t that people believed in the existence of
            this invisible person. <br />
            It was more like people accepted my nonsense and played along with
            it. <br />
            I came to be treated as a pitiable, but amusing person. <br />
            <br />
            That summer, I was the best clown in town. <br />
            For better or worse. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Oh, yes. When I did a toast with Miyagi at the bar, the man sitting
            next to me talked to me. <br />
            &ldquo;Are you that person from the other day?&rdquo;, he asked.
            <br />
            <br />
            I didn&rsquo;t remember him myself, but apparently he was a music
            student, and one of the people I gave 10,000 yen to that day. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard all sorts of rumors about you. <br />
            The happy man who&rsquo;s alone, but pretends he has a girlfriend
            right next to him.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Wow, sounds like quite a guy,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You heard
            of him?&rdquo;, I asked, turning to Miyagi. <br />
            &ldquo;No, never!&rdquo;, Miyagi smiled. <br />
            <br />
            The man smiled bitterly at this. <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;You know, I feel like I understand. <br />
            There&rsquo;s some deep reason for all this, isn&rsquo;t there?
            <br />
            Would you mind telling me what it is?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            He was the first to ask me anything like that. <br />
            I took his hand and thanked him deeply. <br />
            <br />
            And then I told him about all of it. <br />
            About how I was poor. About how I sold my lifespan. About the
            observers. <br />
            About my parents. About my friend. About the time capsule. <br />
            About my future. About my childhood friend. About the vending
            machines. <br />
            And about Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            In the middle of all of it, I let something slip. <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never told her myself, but I love Miyagi so deeply
            I&rsquo;m not even sure what to do.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Sitting next to me, she nearly spilled her drink. <br />
            Because indeed, I had never outright told Miyagi &ldquo;I love
            you.&rdquo; <br />
            I was so amused by her reaction, I almost fell over laughing. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;So I want to make it up to her for wasting her 300,000 yen,
            and for doubting her. <br />
            Above all, I want to do something to reduce her debt if I can.
            <br />
            Because I don&rsquo;t want her to be in such danger any
            longer.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            But as I get serious, the world gets bored. <br />
            <br />
            The man looked highly dubious. <br />
            He didn&rsquo;t believe a word of my story. <br />
            Perhaps he only thought that if he listened to my story, I would
            give him money again. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The man left, and I got ready to leave myself when a middle-aged man
            behind me called out. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Excuse me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to eavesdrop, but I heard your
            story.&rdquo; <br />
            The man, wearing a cheap suit, scratched his head. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;Well, be honest, what do you think?&rdquo;, I asked.
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;That girl&rsquo;s right there, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;, he
            said, looking where Miyagi was. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Ah, well-guessed. You&rsquo;re right, and she&rsquo;s cute
            too,&rdquo; I said, patting Miyagi&rsquo;s head. <br />
            Miyagi closed her eyes as if ticklish. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I thought so. &#8230;Um, forgive me, but could I have some
            time with you two?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            The man placed emphasis on &ldquo;you two.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this brief, but Mr. Kusunoki, I&rsquo;ve had
            a similar experience to yours. <br />
            When I was about your age, my brother three years older helped me
            out of a deep depression in a way much like you&rsquo;re doing for
            Ms. Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            Much like you, I was determined to repay my brother somehow. <br />
            But I didn&rsquo;t have enough time for it. <br />
            My brother disappeared. And I could do nothing.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            The man stopped to finish his glass. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;If I could give some advice, it would be to listen as closely
            as you can. <br />
            &#8230;And then you might make it in time. <br />
            It will be close, but you can still make it.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            After the man left, I thought over his words. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Listen as closely as you can.&rdquo; What on earth did he
            mean? <br />
            Was he really just saying to literally strain my ears? <br />
            Or was it a famous aphorism with a deeper meaning? <br />
            Or did it have no meaning at all, just something that came out of
            his mouth? <br />
            <br />
            We reached the apartment, and I got into bed with Miyagi. <br />
            &ldquo;That man was quite nice,&rdquo; Miyagi said, and fell asleep.
            <br />
            She was sleeping soundly, as peacefully as a child. <br />
            I never got used to it, and never got tired of it. <br />
            <br />
            I got out of bed, careful not to wake Miyagi, and drank three cups
            of water in the kitchen. <br />
            I picked up her sketchbook in the corner, checked to make sure she
            wasn&rsquo;t awake, and opened it. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            There were many drawings in the sketchbook. <br />
            <br />
            The phone in my room, the broken TV, bottles of alcohol. <br />
            The restaurant, the cafe, the station, the supermarket. <br />
            The duck boat, the amusement park, the fountain, the ferris wheel.
            <br />
            My bike, a can of Pocari Sweat, Snoopy. <br />
            And me sleeping. <br />
            <br />
            I tore out a page from the sketchbook and started drawing Miyagi
            sleeping in return. <br />
            <br />
            Since I always watched Miyagi drawing from beside, I more or less
            knew how to draw. <br />
            I didn&rsquo;t focus on things like drawing well or trying to mimic
            another artist; I just focused on the picture. <br />
            <br />
            When I looked at my completed drawing, I was filled with
            satisfaction, but I also had a tiny feeling that something was
            amiss. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            It was easy to overlook the wrongness. <br />
            It was minor enough that if I just thought about something else, it
            would go away. <br />
            But those words remained in my head. <br />
            &ldquo;Listen as closely as you can.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I concentrated to the best of my ability. <br />
            I strained my senses to find the source of the wrongness. <br />
            <br />
            Then suddenly, I understood. <br />
            The next moment, as if possessed, I intently moved the pencil across
            the sketchbook. <br />
            <br />
            I continued for the entire night. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I took Miyagi to see some fireworks. <br />
            We saw elaborate skyrockets at a fireworks display at the local
            elementary school.<br />
            There were many carts selling things as well. It was a bigger affair
            than I expected.<br />
            <br />
            When children saw me walking and holding hangs with Miyagi, they
            laughed &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Kusunoki!&rdquo; <br />
            Weirdos are popular with kids too. <br />
            <br />
            A group of boys in high school approached and teased me, saying
            &ldquo;What a girl you&rsquo;ve got there!&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;Great, isn&rsquo;t she? Well you can&rsquo;t have her,&rdquo;
            I said, holding Miyagi&rsquo;s shoulder. <br />
            <br />
            I was happy. Even if they didn&rsquo;t believe it, everyone enjoyed
            my &ldquo;Miyagi&rsquo;s right there!&rdquo; nonsense. <br />
            <br />
            We held hands on the way back from the fireworks show. <br />
            I was the only one who knew it would be the final day. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            It was Sunday, which Miyagi took off every two weeks. <br />
            &ldquo;Yo, been a while,&rdquo; the replacement observer said.
            <br />
            <br />
            Normally, I would have thirty-three days left. <br />
            Tomorrow, Miyagi would have come back to me. <br />
            <br />
            But I returned to that building again. <br />
            The place where I first met Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            And there, I sold thirty days of my lifespan. <br />
            <br />
            The replacement observer was surprised. <br />
            &ldquo;Do you know where you&rsquo;re doing here?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            The thirty-some woman at the counter who audited me looked
            bewildered. <br />
            &ldquo;&#8230;I honestly can&rsquo;t recommend this. <br />
            I&rsquo;m seeing that in the next thirty days, you&rsquo;re going to
            paint pictures that end up in art textbooks for years to
            come.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Plainest Pictures.&rdquo; <br />
            That&rsquo;s what my paintings were named, and while they caused a
            lot of dispute, they ultimately sold for very high prices. <br />
            Or rather, that&rsquo;s what would have happened if I hadn&rsquo;t
            sold those thirty days. <br />
            <br />
            What I drew - or would draw - were the landscapes I had imagined
            before I slept since I was five. <br />
            I didn&rsquo;t even realize it, but I had long been piling them up.
            <br />
            And it was none other than Miyagi who taught me how to express them.
            <br />
            <br />
            I don&rsquo;t have much interest in art history, but I was glad to
            make so much off of selling a single month of my life. <br />
            It wasn&rsquo;t quite enough to pay Miyagi&rsquo;s debt, but she
            would be free in just five more years of work. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Thirty days more valuable than thirty years, huh?&rdquo;, the
            observer laughed. <br />
            But they were indeed. <br />
            <br />
            It was the first morning of the remaining three days. <br />
            I wouldn&rsquo;t have an observer&rsquo;s eyes on me. <br />
            Thus, Miyagi was gone. <br />
            <br />
            I decided how I&rsquo;d spend those three days a while ago. <br />
            <br />
            I got on the Cub and went around to the places I went with Miyagi,
            but this time I really was alone. <br />
            <br />
            I drove under a blue sky as if in search of her lingering scent.
            <br />
            <br />
            I wondered if Miyagi was off observing someone else now. <br />
            <br />
            I prayed that they wouldn&rsquo;t attack Miyagi out of desperation.
            <br />
            <br />
            I prayed that Miyagi could keep working until she paid her debt, and
            live such a happy life that she forgot all about me. <br />
            <br />
            I prayed that someone would appear who Miyagi found more important
            than me, and who found Miyagi more important than I had. <br />
            <br />
            While walking in the park, children waved to me. Getting a sudden
            idea, I pretended that Miyagi was there. <br />
            I put out my hand, said &ldquo;Look, Miyagi!&rdquo;, and held an
            imaginary Miyagi&rsquo;s hand. <br />
            <br />
            It was the same as always for everyone else. &ldquo;Ah, that idiot
            Kusunoki&rsquo;s walking with his imaginary girlfriend again.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            But it was very different for me. In fact, it was hardly the same at
            all. <br />
            <br />
            As I went on doing this to myself, I was hit with such sadness I
            could barely stand up. I realized Miyagi&rsquo;s absence more than
            ever. <br />
            <br />
            I had a thought. <br />
            What if it had all been an illusion of mine from the start? <br />
            <br />
            I was convinced my life would end in three days. I knew that all but
            a shred of my life had been used up. That sensation couldn&rsquo;t
            have been a lie. <br />
            But did that girl named Miyagi really exist? Had not only her
            existence, but the existence of a shop dealing in lifespan, been a
            convenient fantasy of mine as I recognized my coming death? <br />
            I had no way of knowing that now. <br />
            <br />
            I sat on the edge of a fountain with my head low, and was called to
            by a boy and girl in middle school. <br />
            The boy innocently asked, &ldquo;Mr. Kusunoki, how&rsquo;s Ms.
            Miyagi?&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;Miyagi&rsquo;s not here anymore,&rdquo; I said. <br />
            <br />
            The girl put her hands to her mouth, shocked. <br />
            &ldquo;Huh? What happened? Did you have a fight?&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;Something like that. Don&rsquo;t fight, you two.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            The two looked at each other and shook their heads in unison. <br />
            &ldquo;Well, I dunno&#8230; I mean, even Mr. Kusunoki and Ms. Miyagi
            argue?&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;If you two get along so well but still fight, then
            there&rsquo;s no way we wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I wanted to say &quot;You know, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; But the
            words wouldn&rsquo;t come out. <br />
            Before I knew it, I was crying like a dam had burst. The more I
            tried to imagine Miyagi beside me to comfort myself, the more the
            tears came. <br />
            The two sat around me in my indecency and tried to console me.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then, surprisingly, I found that there were far more people who knew
            about me than I thought. <br />
            People of all ages crowded around the scene, as if to say
            &ldquo;Kusunoki&rsquo;s doing something new.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Shinbashi&rsquo;s friends Suzumi and Asakura were there. Suzumi
            asked me what had happened. <br />
            I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to answer, so I told them that Miyagi and I
            had fought and split up. I made up a story about how she had turned
            her back on me and abandoned me. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;What about Kusunoki didn&rsquo;t Miyagi like?&rdquo;, a high
            school girl with sharp eyes said angrily. She really spoke like she
            believed Miyagi existed. <br />
            &ldquo;Why, did something happen?&rdquo;, said a man beside her. I
            remembered his face. <br />
            That&rsquo;s right - he was the owner of the photo studio. The first
            person to acknowledge Miyagi existed. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t seem like the kind of person to do something
            so cruel.&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;But does that mean she&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;, Suzumi asked.
            <br />
            A young man in a tank-top said to me, &ldquo;That Miyagi&rsquo;s a
            good-for-nothing girl, ditching a good guy like this!&rdquo;,
            slapping me on the back. <br />
            <br />
            I turned my head up to say something, but I couldn&rsquo;t get any
            words out. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &#8230;Just then, there was a voice from behind me. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Indeed. To think, when he&rsquo;s such a good person.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            I knew the voice, of course. I wouldn&rsquo;t have forgotten it in a
            day or two. <br />
            It would take thirty - three hundred - three thousand years for me
            to forget. <br />
            <br />
            I turned toward it. <br />
            I needed to be sure. <br />
            I couldn&rsquo;t have possibly misheard. <br />
            But until I saw it myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. <br />
            <br />
            She chuckled to herself. <br />
            &ldquo;That Miyagi girl really is a good-for-nothing.&rdquo; <br />
            Miyagi put her arm around my neck and hugged me. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, Mr. Kusunoki. &#8230;I was looking for
            you.&rdquo; <br />
            I reflexively hugged her back, smelling her hair. That smell was one
            with my sense of &ldquo;Miyagi.&rdquo; <br />
            It was indeed her. <br />
            <br />
            I wasn&rsquo;t the only one having trouble digesting the situation.
            Many of the people around were similarly bewildered and amazed. They
            were probably thinking, &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t this Miyagi girl
            supposed to not exist?&rdquo; <br />
            I was stunned into silence when I saw their reaction. Everyone could
            see Miyagi. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Might you be Ms. Miyagi?&rdquo;, a man in a jersey timidly
            asked. <br />
            &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m the good-for-nothing Miyagi,&rdquo; she
            answered, and the man slapped me on the shoulder. <br />
            &ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo;, he laughed. &ldquo;What do you know,
            she really exists. And you&rsquo;re really pretty, Ms. Miyagi!
            I&rsquo;m jealous!&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            But I still didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on. <br />
            Why was Miyagi here? Why could the other people see Miyagi? <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;So Ms. Miyagi&#8230; really was Ms. Miyagi,&rdquo; the high
            school girl said, her eyes wide. &ldquo;&#8230;Yeah, somehow,
            you&rsquo;re exactly like I imagined you.&rdquo; <br />
            Asakura, from the back of the crowd, suggested that they let us be
            alone. So the people left us banter and congratulations as they
            scattered away. <br />
            <br />
            I thanked Asakura. <br />
            &ldquo;Guess Miyagi really was just my kind of girl,&rdquo; Asakura
            laughed. &ldquo;Be happy, you two.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            And then we were alone. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi took my hand and explained. <br />
            &ldquo;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it? How can I be here? How can others
            see me? &#8230;It&rsquo;s simple. I did the same thing you
            did.&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;The same thing&#8230;?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            A few seconds later, I realized what Miyagi meant. <br />
            &ldquo;How much&#8230; did you sell?&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;Also the same. I sold all of it. All but three days.&rdquo;
            <br />
            <br />
            My face went pale. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Just after you sold your lifespan, the other observer
            contacted me. He told me you&rsquo;d sold off even more of your life
            to pay off most of my debt. As soon as I heard that&#8230; I was
            determined. He did the formalities.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            I&rsquo;m sure I should have be saddened. <br />
            The person I had sacrificed everything to protect betrayed my desire
            and threw her own life away - I should have grieved. <br />
            <br />
            And yet, I was happy. <br />
            Her betrayal, her foolishness, was now more dear to me than
            anything. <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi sat beside and leaned on me. <br />
            &ldquo;Quite impressive, Mr. Kusunoki. Buying back the majority of
            my life with just thirty days. &#8230;And I&rsquo;m sorry. I threw
            away the life you worked so hard to get back. I&rsquo;m such a
            fool.&rdquo; <br />
            &ldquo;Fool?&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the fool. I
            couldn&rsquo;t live without you for even three days, Miyagi. I
            wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was going to do.&rdquo; <br />
            Miyagi laughed happily and pressed her chin on my shoulder. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Thanks to you, the value of my life went up a bit as well. So
            not only is the debt paid, there&rsquo;s plenty of money left. More
            than we could possibly go through in three days.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            &quot;So we&rsquo;re rich,&rdquo; I said grandiosely, hugging Miyagi
            and shaking her. <br />
            &ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; Miyagi replied, doing the same. <br />
            Tears poured out again, but so did they for Miyagi, so I
            didn&rsquo;t pay it any mind. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I&rsquo;ll die leaving nothing behind. <br />
            Perhaps some curious person might remember me - as a fool, probably
            - but it&rsquo;s a lot more likely they&rsquo;ll forget. <br />
            <br />
            But I don&rsquo;t mind that. <br />
            I don&rsquo;t need the eternity I once dreamed of now. <br />
            I don&rsquo;t mind if no one remembers me. <br />
            <br />
            Because she&rsquo;s here with me, smiling at my side. <br />
            Just because of that, I can forgive everything else. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;Well, Mr. Kusunoki.&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            Miyagi turned back to me with a lovable grin. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;How do you plan to spend these three days?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I believe those three days, <br />
            <br />
            compared to the tragic thirty years I would have lived, <br />
            <br />
            compared to the worthwhile thirty days I would have lived, <br />
            <br />
            were of much, much more value. <br />
            <br />
