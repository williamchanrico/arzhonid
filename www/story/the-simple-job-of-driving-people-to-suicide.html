							<p>
								My job is primarily the cleaning of rooms. <br />
								<br />
								Why would I go cleaning other&rsquo;s rooms? <br />
								Because it comes along with suicide. <br />
								<br />
								Clean everything up and leave a note, and no one will doubt it was a suicide. <br />
								Making it all tidy. That&rsquo;s the important part. <br />
								<br />
								The procedure goes as follows. <br />
								<br />
								1. Take over the person&rsquo;s body. <br />
								2. Put on an appearance of sadness. <br />
								3. Make the surroundings tidy. (Most crucial step) <br />
								4. Write a note. <br />
								5. Die. <br />
								<br />
								But no, I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;commit suicide.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								My target then was a girl with nervous eyes. <br />
								This ended up being my final job. <br />
								<br />
								All the people I had driven to suicide beforehand certainly seemed like the kind to do wicked things. <br />
								Such a young, harmless-looking target I had not had before. <br />
								<br />
								She was slender and fair-skinned, always kept her gaze low, and had a very restrained laugh. <br />
								<br />

								<br />
								But there could have been no mistake. <br />
								If she was to be my target, she was an evil person. <br />
								<br />
								I had killed others without hesitating, hadn&rsquo;t I? <br />
								<br />
								I closed my eyes, thought about the face of my distant target, and took over her body. <br />
								<br />
								On that sunny day in August, my final job began. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target was gazing out the window. <br />
								<br />
								She was in a high school classroom, seemingly in the middle of class. <br />
								Everyone else was looking up at the blackboard and down at their notebooks, busily writing what was on the board. <br />
								<br />
								This girl alone, my target, was lazily gazing outside. <br />
								<br />
								Not that there was anything of note out there. <br />
								A bus stop, a Lawson store, a drug store, a Joyce. <br />
								A tacky billboard for Bon Curry stood out most. <br />
								Overall, a typical rural landscape. <br />
								<br />
								I attempted to move the target&rsquo;s hand. <br />
								The pen felt unusually large, which was mostly because her hand was so small. <br />
								<br />
								I tried diligently copying what the teacher wrote on the board. <br />
								I was able to move smoothly, as she showed little opposition. <br />
								<br />
								Suddenly I saw the teacher looking her way, seeming surprised. <br />
								The reason for this should become clear later. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								To observe the target&rsquo;s reaction, I wrote &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; in her notebook. <br />
								<br />
								I then temporarily relinquished control. <br />
								The target opened and closed her hand to confirm she was free. <br />
								<br />
								From this, it seemed she was aware of being controlled. <br />
								Some people don&rsquo;t even notice that. <br />
								<br />
								The target stared at the &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; I had written, deeply interested. <br />
								But she displayed no further reaction. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The lecture ended, and lunch break began. <br />
								I took over the target&rsquo;s body again. <br />
								This is when things would really begin. <br />
								<br />
								First, with regard to the target&rsquo;s friends. <br />
								I would have to make it appear to them that the target was in pain. <br />
								<br />
								I could make her sigh often, or eat little, or say unusual things. <br />
								<br />
								By doing this, the people around her could be convinced that there were &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of a suicide, making the possibility reality. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I looked around the classroom in search of her friends. <br />
								<br />
								But no one came to speak with her. <br />
								Or even looked her way, for that matter. <br />
								<br />
								Everyone formed their groups and started on their lunches. <br />
								I waited for someone to call to her. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target remained solitary until halfway through lunch. <br />
								<br />
								I finally came to realize this girl, my target, being isolated was a very commonplace occurrence. <br />
								My target appeared to be very much alone. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I initially thought it worrisome, but thinking on it, it was in fact favorable. <br />
								Someone with no connections to anyone around her could die anytime at all and it wouldn&rsquo;t be suspicious. <br />
								<br />
								Pupils from the same class would have nothing to say but &ldquo;She was always a shy girl&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								She would be categorized as an &ldquo;other.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I let her be for a little while. <br />
								I had nothing to do, after all. <br />
								<br />
								Even without my interference, the target would play the part of &ldquo;someone who might commit suicide.&rdquo; <br />
								I temporarily stopped controlling her. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I was taking control of the target from a one-room apartment. <br />
								I could take over a person&rsquo;s body from anywhere as long as I knew their face. <br />
								<br />
								I set my alarm and began an afternoon nap. <br />
								Controlling people takes considerable stamina. <br />
								<br />
								My next job was the all-important &ldquo;putting things in order.&rdquo; <br />
								I would have to keep my physical condition up until then. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I woke up and checked up on the target. <br />
								Her last class had just ended, and she left the room earlier than anyone else. <br />
								<br />
								She didn&rsquo;t go to any clubs. <br />
								She put in earbuds for a Walkman and headed straight home. <br />
								<br />
								When she came home and entered her room, I took over her body again. <br />
								I observed the room through her own eyes. <br />
								<br />
								My first impression was: <br />
								&ldquo;What IS this?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I was at a loss for a moment. <br />
								My job was to put her things in order, but there was nothing. <br />
								Literally nothing in the room besides a bare minimum of furniture and some textbooks. <br />
								<br />
								No magazines, no regular books, no TV, no computer, no cushions, no dolls, no plants. <br />
								The room was completely barren. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Depending on the person, this part of the job could take as long as five hours even for someone with my experience. <br />
								But for this girl, it was over in two minutes. <br />
								<br />
								The only trash around was bottles of alcohol, stuffed away in her lowest drawer. <br />
								I started to put them into a bag, but thinking about it, leaving them around felt more befitting of a suicide. <br />
								So I put them back where they were. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The one trace of personality I could find was a mess of CDs on her shelves, as well as a CD player and headphones to listen to them. <br />
								<br />
								Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith. <br />
								Definitely the tastes of a depressed person. <br />
								<br />
								These, too, felt appropriate to have in the room, so I left them be. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								It was the first time the job had been so easy. <br />
								It felt like I was merely setting a table. <br />
								<br />
								It seemed it would be no problem to have her commit suicide right then and there. <br />
								I didn&rsquo;t think it would be wise to tinker with things any further. <br />
								<br />
								I had a sense of&#8230; perhaps not disappointment, but of being cheated. <br />
								Still, I was pleased it would be easy. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								To finish, I wrote a suicide note with the target&rsquo;s hand. <br />
								Tearing out a page from a history textbook, I wrote &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all pointless. I&rsquo;m killing myself.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								If this girl were to write a suicide note herself, I felt it would be sudden and simple, and wouldn&rsquo;t blame anyone in particular. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I put the note in her pocket and was about to leave the house. <br />
								<br />
								Suddenly, the target showed her first opposition. <br />
								And it was, in fact, unbelievably powerful. <br />
								She very nearly took control back. <br />
								<br />
								She moved her mouth to say &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; <br />
								In forcing it open, she cut her lip and it started to bleed. <br />
								<br />
								I was surprised, but also relieved. <br />
								Things had been going almost disgustingly well. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target said this: <br />
								&ldquo;I want you to make a little change to the note.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Instead of speaking myself, I had the girl say: <br />
								&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; <br />
								An observer would have seen her talking to herself. <br />
								<br />
								She replied. <br />
								&ldquo;Will you change &quot;It&rsquo;s all pointless, I&rsquo;m killing myself&rdquo; for me?&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;Why?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I want people to think &quot;It&rsquo;s for the best that she died.&rdquo; If that&rsquo;s possible&#8230;&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I was quiet for a while, but figured it couldn&rsquo;t hurt. <br />
								I modified the note as she instructed. <br />
								<br />
								I felt the target attempt to say &quot;Thank you very much.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								It seemed the job was to end without her even pleading for her life. <br />
								What on earth was this girl thinking? <br />
								<br />
								All of a sudden, I realized something. <br />
								<br />
								Was it possible this girl was intending to commit suicide from the start? <br />
								<br />
								She&rsquo;d totally cleaned out her room, she knew what she&rsquo;d want in her suicide note. <br />
								Weren&rsquo;t those things independent of my interference? <br />
								<br />
								If this was true, all I was doing was killing a suicidal girl who already wished for death herself. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								That was not what I wanted. <br />
								It would be no fun killing someone longing for death. <br />
								<br />
								So I decided I would tease this girl before killing her. <br />
								<br />
								I took over the target&rsquo;s body, prepared a different farewell note, left it on the living room table, and left the house. <br />
								I then had her walk the whole night. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The town was unusually hilly. <br />
								With all the stairs and slopes, not many people rode bikes. <br />
								There were many steep inclines, and many winding roads on top of that. <br />
								<br />
								I had her walk endlessly through this place, on feet so delicate they might break if she tripped. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Crickets chirped through the terribly humid night. <br />
								The girl soon started to sweat. <br />
								<br />
								After walking three hours in uncomfortable shoes, her legs seemed to be in terrible pain. <br />
								<br />
								Pain ran through the arches of her feet and calves. <br />
								She felt it with every step I made her take. <br />
								She couldn&rsquo;t even look up. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								By the time she was getting unbearably thirsty, I gave her control in front of a vending machine. <br />
								She had only some change with her. <br />
								<br />
								The point of this was to have her buy and drink something of her own volition. <br />
								<br />
								Even still, the weariness kept building. <br />
								The pain kept getting worse. <br />
								She continued getting hungrier. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								After walking eight hours, the target finally arrived at her destination. <br />
								<br />
								It was a platform giving a view of the entire town. <br />
								As she reached the top of the spiral stairs, I gave her back control. <br />
								<br />
								Moved beyond her limits, she collapsed on the spot. <br />
								I placed her body on a chair I had prepared. <br />
								<br />
								I sat across from her on the other side of a table. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target greedily ate through hundred-yen cup ramen. <br />
								Forgetting about her wish for death, she leant on the handrail with her elbows, looking down at the town. <br />
								&ldquo;Pretty&#8230;&rdquo; she remarked. <br />
								<br />
								She seemed to lack the energy to think about anything, making no effort to keep up an appearance. <br />
								She turned around, crossed her legs, and laid back in the chair smiling. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target looked back and asked me: &ldquo;By the way, will you kill me or not?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I wanted to explain myself, but I couldn&rsquo;t find the right words. <br />
								I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to think about things, either. <br />
								<br />
								Of course, the target was exhausted from eight hours of walking. <br />
								But I was just as tired if not moreso from making her walk for eight hours. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I decided to take the target back home. <br />
								I beckoned to her, and she silently followed. <br />
								She seemed particularly obedient, from what I could tell. <br />
								Well, I was able to control her, after all. <br />
								<br />
								We staggered down the spiral stairs. <br />
								I opened the car door and got inside when I was struck with an incredible drowsiness. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target stood looking worried in front of the car, so I opened the passenger door and said &ldquo;Get in.&rdquo; <br />
								She said &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; and got in the seat. <br />
								<br />
								I was unable to resist sleep, so I decided to take a ten-minute nap and then set out. <br />
								I fell asleep in the middle of setting the alarm on my phone. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I woke up feeling warm. <br />
								The light of sunrise was shining into the car. <br />
								<br />
								Looking to my left, I saw the girl sleeping. <br />
								I opened the door, got out, and washed my face at a fountain under the platform. <br />
								<br />
								I was sweating all over, so I went back to the car to get a towel. <br />
								Just then, the target woke up, and looked at me drowsily. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								While we wiped our sweat with the wet towel, I pondered how I should begin explaining myself. <br />
								<br />
								The dry wind was pleasant and refreshing. <br />
								The target pulled off her shoes and socks and washed her feet. <br />
								<br />
								Usually the target would be asking something by now, but this girl hadn&rsquo;t said anything for some time. <br />
								I was just about to give up. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;All clean. Go ahead,&rdquo; the target suddenly said. <br />
								She looked at me attentively. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target spread out her arms and opened her hands. <br />
								&ldquo;Drop me, hang me, do whatever you want.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Water dripped from her hair, and her wet hands and feet gleamed. <br />
								<br />
								I didn&rsquo;t care for that. <br />
								&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll kill you soon. In a very terrible way.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;A very terrible way?&rdquo;, she repeated with a stupid look on her face. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. Just get in the car.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								The target put on her shoes and walked to the car. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We got a good breakfast, and I took the target to school. <br />
								<br />
								The target typically came late and wanted me to delay her going to class, so she actually arrived earlier than usual. <br />
								She got out of the car, looked back at me, bowed slightly, and walked away. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I had my own first period class to get to, but there was something to be done before that. <br />
								<br />
								I closed my eyes and imagined the target&rsquo;s face. <br />
								She had just entered the classroom. <br />
								<br />
								The target was opening the door quietly so as not to draw any attention. <br />
								However, a group near the door looked her way to see who was coming in. <br />
								<br />
								Just then, the target&rsquo;s face suddenly brightened, and she greeted them. &ldquo;Morning!&rdquo;<br />
								Naturally, this was my doing. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								No one responded to the greeting. <br />
								Of course, no one had expected her to greet them like that. <br />
								They just figured they must have misheard her. <br />
								<br />
								The target&rsquo;s face turned a deep red. <br />
								She couldn&rsquo;t help being embarrassed by it. <br />
								She was fine with dying, but didn&rsquo;t like having her greeting ignored. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								But afterward, every time the target passed by a classmate in the hall, I had her bow her head to them. <br />
								<br />
								The target wrote, &ldquo;Give me a break&rdquo; in her notebook so as to tell it to me, but I displayed no reaction. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								At lunch, the target tossed Calorie Mates into her mouth. <br />
								She put in her earbuds and started to study, so I took control and removed them. <br />
								<br />
								By just putting in those earbuds, she was making herself look like someone who&rsquo;s given up on communicating. <br />
								<br />
								The target wrote in the notebook: &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I borrowed her hand to cross it out, and underneath, wrote &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just pestering you.&rdquo;<br />
								She looked at this and just wrote &ldquo;Jerk.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Once all her classes were over, the target left the classroom sooner than anyone else. <br />
								Usually she left calmly, but today she was in a hurry. <br />
								<br />
								But open returning home, she was visited by further tragedy. <br />
								Brought about by me, of course. <br />
								<br />
								I took over her body and began tidying up her room once more. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Her lowest drawer was filled with whiskey. <br />
								Cutty Sark, Johnnie Walker Red, Ancient Clan. <br />
								<br />
								I didn&rsquo;t know where she had gotten it, but I drained the bottles - likely to be the girl&rsquo;s best friends - down the sink. <br />
								<br />
								The target tried to say &ldquo;Stop! That&rsquo;s such a waste!&rdquo; <br />
								It might have been her most desperate reaction so far. <br />
								But I didn&rsquo;t care. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								According to the girl&rsquo;s schedule, now would have been a good time for her to lie down on her bed and listen to music. <br />
								Instead, I put the bottles in a vinyl bag, placed it back in the drawer, and had her leave the house. <br />
								<br />
								But I wouldn&rsquo;t have her walk eight hours straight this time. <br />
								After about ten minutes, she arrived at her destination, the park. <br />
								<br />
								I had her sit on one of two swings. <br />
								Naturally, I was sitting on the other. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The sky was gloomy, and sunset was approaching. <br />
								I gave the target the flowerpot I was holding. <br />
								&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;, she asked. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;An aglaonema nitidum curtisii,&rdquo; I replied. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;No, not the description. What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Your room is so dreary. Use this to spice it up a little.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Is this more of your pestering?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Can you think of it as a present?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The target held the flowerpot and stared at it. <br />
								&ldquo;I mean, I could. I guess it&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I can live with that, I suppose.&rdquo; <br />
								I got off the swing and stood in front of the target. <br />
								<br />
								She held the flowerpot on her lap, looking at me somewhat nervously. <br />
								<br />
								After a while of this, the target gently let the pot down at her feet. <br />
								&ldquo;Will you kill me?&rdquo;, she said, starting to swing. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I asked her again: <br />
								&ldquo;Do you want to be killed, then?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hm&#8230; I think I&rsquo;d rather be killed than commit suicide,&rdquo; the target replied. <br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your first time, right? I&rsquo;m just number&#8230; whatever, right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I thought a little bit and said: <br />
								&ldquo;Exactly how much do you know?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								The target stopped swinging, and said, glancing at the pot rather than me: <br />
								&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that much. Just that what you&rsquo;re doing now is what I used to do.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I drove eight people to suicide. The targets&rsquo; ages went from 19 to 72. <br />
								Six were men, two were women. I had four jump off a building. Hanged three. The other died by razor.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;m betting it was the same for you. <br />
								One day, I was suddenly able to control people&rsquo;s bodies, and at the same time I felt like I had to do something with it. <br />
								Sound about right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I felt like I was doing a good thing. <br />
								The best thing about it was that every time I drove someone to suicide, I died myself, and it felt like I was reborn.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What about you? Do you know why you have your powers?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I shook my head. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;This is just a total guess, but I think the baton&rsquo;s been passed from me to you. <br />
								And the reason for that is because I stopped killing people. <br />
								<br />
								With my ninth target, I made a simple mistake. <br />
								I sympathized with her.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And then, all of a sudden, I lost my powers. <br />
								My target ran away from me and committed suicide herself. <br />
								So maybe a successor appeared to take my place. <br />
								Maybe somebody decided I wasn&rsquo;t useful anymore.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								The target looked up at me and asked: <br />
								&ldquo;The first person you killed&#8230; It was a woman in her twenties, wasn&rsquo;t it? <br />
								Shoulder-length brown hair, tall, with pretty fingers&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								The target took my silence as an affirmation. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t kill that woman. <br />
								You never would&rsquo;ve guessed it, but it turned out her favorite pastime was talking to photographs. <br />
								<br />
								I don&rsquo;t know why, but that kind of thing&#8230; <br />
								It just made me lose all my motivation, I guess.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;A while after I let her go, I lost the ability to take over people&rsquo;s bodies. <br />
								And a while after that, now I&rsquo;ve gotten controlled myself.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								The target pointed at me. &ldquo;By you, obviously.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ve &quot;outlived my usefulness,&rdquo; huh? <br />
								The successor comes to take out the predecessor - maybe that&rsquo;s how it works?&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;For all I know, some of the people I drove to suicide might have been doing what I was.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So,&rdquo; the target smiled, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better kill me soon, huh? <br />
								Because if you don&rsquo;t, you could be targeted next.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Instead of responding to that, I asked the question again. <br />
								&ldquo;So do you want to be killed?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I think that would be best.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But do YOU want to be killed?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Me? &#8230;Well, I&rsquo;m scared to die. <br />
								But even so, I think death would be easier than living. <br />
								So, yeah. Maybe I do want to be killed.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d better, then,&rdquo; I responded. <br />
								&ldquo;But sorry, I&rsquo;m not here to give you an easy way out. <br />
								I want you to die lamenting that the time wasn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								The target looked at me, expressionless. <br />
								&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll die before that happens.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Sounds good. I think death would be easier than living.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Please don&rsquo;t imitate me like that.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;The algaonema doesn&rsquo;t like direct sunlight.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; The target looked down at the flowerpot. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But you need to put it in a sunny place. <br />
								So, weird as it sounds, finding a &quot;bright shadow&rdquo; is best for it.&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&rdquo;&#8230;Er, you are going to kill me soon, right? <br />
								Because if you don&rsquo;t, someone else might kill you?&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;It likes high temperate and humidity, so put it somewhere warm. <br />
								Spray the leaves with water once a day. <br />
								Same with the water as with the sun: lots, but not too much.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not raising a plant&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m at it, I should mention it&rsquo;s expensive. <br />
								You could buy about ten bottles of that whiskey.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Huh?!&rdquo; The target&rsquo;s body stiffened. <br />
								Her head was likely filled with beer bottles. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;If you let it wilt, I&rsquo;ll take over your body and go around telling your classmates &quot;Please be my friend!&rdquo;&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;Give that stuff a rest already, please. <br />
								So this agla&#8230; nidum&#8230; What was it again?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Just curtisii is fine. Remember it!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Courtesy?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Good enough.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Azure Skye.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Hm?&rdquo; I looked up at the stars. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name. Please remember it.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Oh, your name&#8230; Yeah, I know.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Not Cloudie Skye.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Nope, Azure. Not the most fitting name, is it?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Claude Skye,&rdquo; I said. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t tease me&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s an amazing coincidence.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hmph. Glad you&rsquo;ve got a fitting name,&rdquo; Azure said, pouting. <br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;So, you want me to take this curtisii back home with me?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, of course.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That&rsquo;s embarrassing&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of embarrassment from here on out.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m gonna die just after today&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t die that easily.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It sounds so convincing coming from you.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better break this up soon,&rdquo; I said, watching Azure. <br />
								&ldquo;After all, you seem to be enjoying this all too much.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure recoiled as if hurt and her expression tightened. <br />
								&ldquo;Yeah right&#8230;&rdquo; she said, her face turning red. <br />
								<br />
								For someone like Azure, appearing to enjoy talking with others was the most agonizing thing there was. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Goodbye, Mr. Claude.&rdquo; Azure left the park. <br />
								She hurried off as if running away, so that no one in the park would notice. <br />
								<br />
								But a classmate of Azure&rsquo;s saw her leaving the park and the flowerpot she carried.<br />
								He averted his eyes, as if he&rsquo;d seen something he shouldn&rsquo;t have. <br />
								<br />
								I promptly took control of Azure&rsquo;s body and said &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; with a smile. <br />
								The boy looked very concerned, but said &ldquo;Hey there,&rdquo; bowing his head slightly. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The classmate left, and Azure returned to me. <br />
								&ldquo;Just what are you trying to pull?&rdquo; <br />
								She was in tears. How embarrassed was she? <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I want to make you do things you don&rsquo;t want to do. <br />
								And I don&rsquo;t want to let you do anything you want to do.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t people think I&rsquo;m weird? <br />
								They&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m stealing plants from the park!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Does it matter? You&rsquo;re going to die anyway, right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, sure, but until I do, I&rsquo;m still going to be thinking about what happens after!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well said. Precisely. So it&rsquo;s worth doing.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Looking utterly shocked, Azure said: &ldquo;Do you enjoy teasing high school girls?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best. You should try it sometime.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Every day afterward, whenever Azure passed an acquaintance, I had her politely greet them, and sometimes even start up a conversation. <br />
								Regrettably, her classes ended by the time people had gotten accustomed to Azure actually talking. <br />
								<br />
								After her last class, I thought Azure was going to make a beeline out of the room, but she wrote a message in the corner of her notebook, likely directed at me. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure sat on the swing as I had made her do before. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Due to it being a hot day, the swings were extremely hot as well. <br />
								<br />
								Azure had come to confirm that she was raising the curtisii properly. <br />
								And as far as I could tell, she had made no significant mistakes. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Damn, it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo; I wiped away my sweat. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Let it flow like a river. It&rsquo;s refreshing.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I ignored her and covered my body with sunscreen. <br />
								Azure periodically threw pebbles at me. <br />
								<br />
								I took over Azure&rsquo;s body and had her spray her forehead at the water fountain. <br />
								<br />
								Soon, Azure and her uniform were soaking wet. <br />
								&ldquo;Refreshing,&rdquo; she said, sitting on the swing. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You&rsquo;re already on summer vacation, huh? I wanted to try more things.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I love summer vacation!&rdquo;, Azure cheered. <br />
								&ldquo;I can just stay at home and not meet anybody. <br />
								Too bad SOMEbody threw out all my alcohol&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like meeting people or going out, huh?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
								Azure recoiled like she&rsquo;d made a mistake and mumbled &ldquo;Err&#8230; If I had to say&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I took over Azure&rsquo;s body and dug around in her pockets. <br />
								But I couldn&rsquo;t find what I was looking for, so I relinquished control. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You,&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your cellphone?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Phone? I don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a cellphone? A girl in high school, in this day and age?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Surely you can tell I don&rsquo;t need one. <br />
								Haven&rsquo;t you noticed that yet?&rdquo; Azure wrung out her hair. <br />
								<br />
								Indeed, if Azure had a phone, it would serve her no purpose a clock wouldn&rsquo;t. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What were you going to do?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Call a friend and invite them over.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;No thanks!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s lucky. It&rsquo;d hurt, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Yeah. Immediately.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Since you don&rsquo;t want to meet people or go outside, then I thought I&rsquo;d have people come out and meet you.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point? I&rsquo;m already outside, and I&rsquo;m meeting with Mr. Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s take that a step further,&rdquo; I suggested. <br />
								Or rather, decided. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure seemed to want a drink, so I took her to a coffee shop. <br />
								I ordered two espressos. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I hate coffee. It&rsquo;s so bitter.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s still strange to hear from someone who drinks whiskey.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Coffee pretty much tastes like poison.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Spoken like a true poison-drinker?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah, using other people&rsquo;s bodies, but&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I didn&rsquo;t say anything, so Azure smiled, &ldquo;It was a joke!&rdquo; <br />
								Even if it was, it didn&rsquo;t make much sense and wasn&rsquo;t very funny. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I looked through the books on the table, and Azure stared at me oddly. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Are you studying?&rdquo; <br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. Exams are coming up.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I see&#8230; Alright then. I&rsquo;ll study too.&rdquo; <br />
								Azure took an English book out of her bag. <br />
								Seeing it made me feel somehow nostalgic. <br />
								<br />
								Our coffee arrived. Azure timidly sipped it after putting in plenty of sugar. <br />
								&ldquo;Yuuuck!&rdquo; Her face contorted. &ldquo;Still bitter&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								After about two hours of study, Azure stretched and told me: <br />
								&ldquo;By the way. I lost my powers about a week after my target ran away.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. I&rsquo;m not letting you get away.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Is that how it looks to an observer, I wonder?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yep. Definitely a professional killer after his target.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hmph&#8230;&rdquo; Azure said unenthusiastically. <br />
								&ldquo;This has been going pretty well, though. <br />
								Huh, I guess this might actually be a good place to study.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What the hell,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop studying, then.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We entered the movie theater and went down the stairs. <br />
								&ldquo;Well, this definitely isn&rsquo;t a good place for studying,&rdquo; Azure said, looking around restlessly. <br />
								<br />
								Exhausted from cramming for exams daily, I fell asleep minutes into the movie. <br />
								<br />
								It was almost over when I woke up. <br />
								The characters were crying over something emotional. <br />
								Don&rsquo;t get so beat up about it, I thought. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What was the movie like?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
								Azure replied, &ldquo;It was about a murderer who gets a terrible punishment.&rdquo; <br />
								I felt the film makers would probably be disappointed with that description. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You know, people who kill others usually end up dying at the end of movies and shows.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s always death to people who kill,&rdquo; I said, then sneezed. <br />
								&ldquo;People look for that sort of justice.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But what if a person could change?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, I dunno. Once you kill somebody, even if you&rsquo;re a total saint afterward, you just can&rsquo;t quite be trusted.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So people would think we&rsquo;d be better off dead?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s what it comes down to.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;For some reason, that almost excites me,&rdquo; Azure remarked after we left the theater. <br />
								&ldquo;We&rsquo;re two youths who shouldn&rsquo;t be alive.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;How does that excite you?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re Azure and Claude!&rdquo;, Azure said, peering at me. <br />
								She smiled in a way that expected a response. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I was about to reply with something mean-spirited. <br />
								<br />
								When all of a sudden, I felt like I was being watched. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Azure,&rdquo; I said quickly. <br />
								&ldquo;Remember when you resisted to make me revise the suicide note? <br />
								How were you able to do that so forcefully?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well&#8230;&rdquo; Azure started to say, then got suspicious. <br />
								&ldquo;Could it be&#8230; Are you being controlled?&rdquo;, she asked. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine. I just felt like I was being watched for a second.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Ah&#8230; Huh, I kinda feel it too.&rdquo; <br />
								Azure shyly smiled for whatever reason. <br />
								&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve finally become a target yourself. Buddies!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be sure yet. It could just be my imagination.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But if you are starting to get targeted, why would they go for you before me? <br />
								Going off what we talked about before, I should be killed first.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I thought so too, but there&rsquo;s two &quot;people who should be dead&rdquo; here. Which means&#8230;&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&quot;Which means killing you and then me would be the quickest and easiest way.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure nodded in agreement. <br />
								&ldquo;Whoever it is, they made a smart move. <br />
								I&rsquo;ve been controlled before, but it&rsquo;s your first time, so you can&rsquo;t resist too well. <br />
								So I see&#8230; Maybe I&rsquo;ll be personally killed by Claude himself&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, tell me already. How did you resist being controlled?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure turned away, then sharply remarked: <br />
								&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. Because I know you want to know.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We had just left the plaza. <br />
								As we passed under the shade of a tree, I circled behind Azure and wrapped my right arm around her thin neck. <br />
								<br />
								It was my first time being taken over. <br />
								It didn&rsquo;t feel very odd at all, so I was fooled into thinking I was moving by myself. <br />
								<br />
								My brain must have been thinking &ldquo;My arm moved, so I guess I told it to move.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Force was gradually put into my arm, wrapped around Azure&rsquo;s neck. <br />
								Thinking I had no other choice, I took over Azure&rsquo;s body and tried to thrust myself away. <br />
								<br />
								But Azure could resist it. <br />
								She defied my control and didn&rsquo;t do anything. <br />
								Indeed, this told me that she truly did want me to kill her. <br />
								<br />
								But it also gave me a hint. <br />
								<br />
								As Azure&rsquo;s body started going limp, I gradually pulled my arm away from her neck.<br />
								Azure slipped through and fell to the ground. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								After my attempt to defy the control, my arm hurt like it&rsquo;d been smacked with something hard and all my skin turned inside-out. <br />
								<br />
								Once I&rsquo;d confirmed I could move my arms freely again, I looked up at Azure. <br />
								&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not about &quot;resisting&rdquo; control&#8230; It&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;overwriting&rdquo; it, isn&rsquo;t it?&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure coughed, looking displeased. <br />
								&quot;What a shame&#8230; You figured it out too quickly.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So did you know about that to begin with?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;No. I figured it out from how you resisted me. <br />
								Taking control while being controlled made for a good learning experience.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I see&#8230; But I bet your body hurts like heck, huh?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. Not even really sure what I&rsquo;m saying, it hurts so bad.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Same here. And I&rsquo;m dizzy. And it&rsquo;s hot, of course. <br />
								Claude, my neck was really sweaty, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Not really&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yes it was. Man, that&rsquo;s embarrassing&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								Azure was always the type to worry about incidental things. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well then&#8230;&rdquo; I squatted down and looked at Azure. <br />
								She averted her eyes, and I pulled on her cheeks. <br />
								&ldquo;Ow, owww!&rdquo;, she said, the energy gone from her voice. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So what was that &quot;I can&rsquo;t tell you&rdquo; thing about, huh?&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;I was imitating you. Ha ha!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Not to mention resisting my control&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And because I did that, you got the hang of it. That&rsquo;s good, right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I tried to stand up, but lost my balance and fell on my hands, cutting one on a twig on the ground. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We were having a surprising amount of trouble moving. <br />
								Just standing up made us sweat. <br />
								We moved on at a caterpillar&rsquo;s pace looking for refreshment. <br />
								<br />
								We went to sit on the edge of a water fountain in the park, but I fell right in. <br />
								That&rsquo;s what happens when you have no power in your abs. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Coming up out of the water, I rubbed my face with my hands. <br />
								Passersby in the plaza focused their attention on me. <br />
								Azure laughed, though carefully, given her aching body. <br />
								<br />
								I sat on my hands in the water and looked up at the sky. <br />
								An airplane left a trail among the clouds. <br />
								<br />
								Two crows on a nearby tree looked at me. <br />
								They looked like they were watching their soon-to-be prey. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What are you even doing?&rdquo;, Azure asked. <br />
								&ldquo;Someone controlling you again?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Who cares? It&rsquo;s refreshing,&rdquo; I replied. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Please, my whole body hurts. Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Go on, laugh yourself to death.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure stood on the edge of the fountain and leapt in next to me. <br />
								She made a splash, and I covered my eyes. <br />
								People in the plaza looked toward us again. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure didn&rsquo;t come up after ten seconds, so I helped her get up. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I was about to drown to death,&rdquo; Azure gasped. <br />
								&ldquo;In water shallower than a kiddie pool, at that.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&quot;High School Girl Dies in Water Fountain&rdquo;? <br />
								That&rsquo;d raise some eyebrows.&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;Feels nice,&rdquo; Azure said, closing her eyes. <br />
								&ldquo;So if you got controlled again, could you resist?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;About that. Why aren&rsquo;t they pursuing us? <br />
								They could have just kept your head down and drowned you there.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re surprised we could resist? <br />
								You&rsquo;re experienced, Claude. What do you know about people resisting?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I thought a little bit before answering. <br />
								&ldquo;Your case is unusual in more ways than one. <br />
								It probably wouldn&rsquo;t surprise someone that you&rsquo;d resist.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I wasn&rsquo;t trying to praise Azure with that, but she looked pleased. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But if it were someone else, then sure, they&rsquo;d probably be surprised, and might look into what was going on.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I see&#8230; Ah, right. Take this, Claude!&rdquo; <br />
								Azure splashed water at my face. I silently splashed back with twice as much. <br />
								<br />
								After doing that for a while, we got out and wrung out our clothes. <br />
								Still dripping, we went over to sit on a bench and waited for them to dry. <br />
								<br />
								A bell rang through the plaza to indicate closing time. <br />
								<br />
								Our clothes were dry. Azure sneezed and yawned at the same time. <br />
								&ldquo;Well, see you,&rdquo; she said, and left. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I thought it was possible I&rsquo;d never meet Azure again after that. <br />
								<br />
								If they were to seriously come for us, even with our meager resistance, it would probably only be a matter of time. <br />
								<br />
								I figured I would at least try to make my room dirty. <br />
								If only to add to the workload for the cleaner. <br />
								<br />
								Two weeks passed. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Then, when I was reading a book in a coffee shop, I thought I heard my name being called. <br />
								Of course, that name wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Claude Skye.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								When I looked up, I saw an employee waving at me excitedly. <br />
								She was an upperclassman at my school who was friendly enough to greet me if we saw each other. <br />
								<br />
								Soon, we were having a conversation. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								After a reasonable amount of time, I quietly left without being noticed by my friend.<br />
								<br />
								I decided I would stop coming to this place. <br />
								It was a place I rather liked, but if I had acquaintances there, I had no other choice.<br />
								<br />
								Just as I sighed over having to find a new coffee shop, my body was suddenly taken over. <br />
								<br />
								I wondered, was I too late? <br />
								<br />
								After inspecting my own body, I started walking straight ahead. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Imagining the pain that was soon to come, I opposed control and moved my mouth. <br />
								I attempted to communicate with the person who was trying to kill me. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Just two minutes. Let me talk.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								But my body kept moving on its own. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;This has to do with you, too!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Pain ripped through my tongue. <br />
								My lips were cut and bled. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hey, why do you think a target suddenly comes to mind, anyway? <br />
								And why do you feel the need to drive them to suicide?&rdquo; <br />
								I chose my words carefully. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I led six targets to their deaths. <br />
								Maybe the exact same way as you. <br />
								But I couldn&rsquo;t kill my seventh.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And so now, you&rsquo;re after my life. <br />
								What I was doing to other people, now someone else is doing to me.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really know what it&rsquo;s like for the people you&rsquo;re taking over the bodies of. <br />
								I know it now that I&rsquo;m the one being controlled, but the fact of being controlled isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s easily noticeable.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It feels awfully natural, having your body taken over and moved. <br />
								Maybe what&rsquo;s happening seems strange, but it&rsquo;s hard to identify the reason.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m going to say now, well, there&rsquo;s no proof for it, and it&rsquo;s skipping over logic.<br />
								But most importantly, it&rsquo;s a theory that I would be happy with.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hypothetically, what if we who take over people&rsquo;s bodies are actually being controlled ourselves? <br />
								We feel like we&rsquo;re thinking for ourselves and killing people, but what if it&rsquo;s not really us?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I realized I had hit my limit. <br />
								I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to talk any more. <br />
								<br />
								I did not feel my feet stop. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								It was getting dark. <br />
								On the road, I saw children in yukatas, grade-school boys on bikes, stylish middle school couples, and people heading to a festival. <br />
								<br />
								A brother and sister, about eight and six years old, sprayed each other with bug spray, the smell of which reached me. <br />
								I heard the sound of a flute in the distance. <br />
								I smelled burnt sauce as well. <br />
								<br />
								I thought I heard my name being called. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I couldn&rsquo;t move my eyes, but I saw a blue skirt in the corner of my vision. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;My job was over quick after you left. <br />
								Then I walked over here and saw you&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								I knew who it was from her voice. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So, uh,&rdquo; my friend started. <br />
								&ldquo;Were you talking to yourself back there?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I looked at her in silence. <br />
								She saw my mouth and gasped, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bleeding!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								She seemed to recognize my gruesome reason for not talking. <br />
								For some reason, she encouraged me with &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be okay!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;A friend of mine knew somebody who had that problem, too. <br />
								But it was just a temporary thing. It&rsquo;s nothing really bad.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I didn&rsquo;t really understand, but it had bought me some time. <br />
								<br />
								I took over my friend&rsquo;s body and threw myself to the ground. <br />
								In judo terms, I used her body to do a ouchi gari on myself. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								By doing this, I had stopped myself. <br />
								I then used my friend to talk for me. <br />
								My body tried to shake off my friend&rsquo;s, but that I was able to resist. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;One day, you&rsquo;re going to meet someone you just can&rsquo;t bring yourself to kill, just like us. <br />
								And in the next moment, your own life will be targeted. <br />
								Why not put a stop to that cycle?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								After saying this, I thought what to say next, with us still in the same positions. <br />
								I eventually realized my body was no longer being controlled. <br />
								<br />
								My shoulder started hurting from the collision with the ground. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I relinquished control of my friend, but her eyes stayed shut, and she didn&rsquo;t move. <br />
								<br />
								I wanted to tell her to get off me, but I couldn&rsquo;t move my mouth at all. <br />
								It seemed it would be a problem for meals as well. <br />
								<br />
								I took over my friend&rsquo;s body again and freed myself. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting any of that to happen&#8230;&rdquo; She was pale. <br />
								&ldquo;And what was I even talking about back there? What&rsquo;s wrong with me&#8230;?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hey, are you hurt? You okay?&rdquo;, my friend asked. <br />
								<br />
								I couldn&rsquo;t move my mouth, so I nodded, and she interpreted it as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; <br />
								But she seemed to think I couldn&rsquo;t talk out of shock. <br />
								She apologized to me over and over, almost about to cry. <br />
								<br />
								I felt sorry for her, but with no easy way to explain, I just ran away. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Going against the crowd of people headed for the festival, I dragged my cold body home. <br />
								I reached my apartment, opened the door, and threw myself onto the bed without undressing. <br />
								<br />
								The room was humid and I was in pain. <br />
								I couldn&rsquo;t even get up to turn on the fan. <br />
								I was terribly thirsty, but I also couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to get water. <br />
								<br />
								Too much trouble, I thought. <br />
								&ldquo;So this is Mr. Claude&rsquo;s house, is it?&rdquo;, Azure said. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I got up and looked toward the kitchen where the voice had come from. <br />
								I saw Azure&rsquo;s face lit by the refrigerator. <br />
								She took out a can of Highball and drank it down. <br />
								<br />
								Azure took the can away from her lips and remarked &ldquo;Tasty!&rdquo; with a smile. <br />
								I was relieved and lied down on the bed again. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Long time no see, Claude - I guess is what I should have said earlier. <br />
								You didn&rsquo;t seem to notice me, so I followed you here.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I wanted to say something, but I couldn&rsquo;t speak well. <br />
								Azure emptied a can and came into the room. <br />
								Her face was slightly red, and she seemed drunk. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Did she not realize I had no energy to move? <br />
								Was she just too drunk? <br />
								Azure started fishing through my things. <br />
								<br />
								She found a carton of cigarettes, remarked &ldquo;Payback for dumping my booze,&rdquo; and tossed them in the trash. <br />
								<br />
								She threw out many of my CDs and books, too. <br />
								But she would occasionally say &ldquo;This is good stuff&rdquo; and put it back on the shelf. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I gestured to Azure and made a cup with my hands to ask for water. <br />
								She filled a cup with cold water in the kitchen and brought it back, exclaiming &ldquo;Behold, water!&rdquo; <br />
								She dribbled it onto me from about a meter above the bed. <br />
								<br />
								I opened my mouth and managed to drink it. <br />
								My face and the bed got completely wet, of course, but I was happy to have some water. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem too energetic today, Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								Azure sat on the bed, poking my face with an empty can. &ldquo;Luckily, I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I gave her a glance of &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You look like you want to go out,&rdquo; Azure said joyfully. <br />
								&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t let you. Ahaha. <br />
								&#8230;Well, anyway, Claude. <br />
								You haven&rsquo;t been talking. Or moving. <br />
								Are you tired? Did something happen?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I didn&rsquo;t respond. <br />
								&ldquo;Huh, whatever,&rdquo; Azure said. <br />
								&ldquo;Anyway, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure moved my body over, got behind me, and wrapped her arm around my neck. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Payback for before,&rdquo; Azure said. <br />
								<br />
								Azure&rsquo;s neck was cold before, but her arm was warm today. <br />
								Or maybe it was just my body that was cold. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m drunk&#8230;&rdquo; Azure said into my ear. <br />
								&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m drunk, I might say some weird stuff, but it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m drunk. So don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So&#8230; Why haven&rsquo;t you been pestering me lately?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure let go of my neck, took her arm down, and put it over my chest. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you been messing with me? <br />
								Claude, why are you leaving me to myself if that&rsquo;s how I want to be?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure poked my chest with her finger. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little lonely, you know? <br />
								And I like being lonely. <br />
								So I&rsquo;m asking you to put a stop to that. <br />
								That&rsquo;s what your job is all about, right, Claude?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure stopped poking. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Plus, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how I want to die, as usual. <br />
								So you should get in the way of that, too. <br />
								Why do I have to tell you that?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I grabbed Azure&rsquo;s neck, and she happily exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, he moves!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								She was right to recommend taking her drunken rambling with a grain of salt. <br />
								But it seemed like Azure wanted me to &ldquo;not worry about her.&rdquo; <br />
								Which made me feel like I had to worry about her. <br />
								It really did feel like it was my duty. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I pushed Azure&rsquo;s hand away and faced her. <br />
								I thought I&rsquo;d first try to explain that I couldn&rsquo;t talk right now, so I pointed to my mouth and made an &ldquo;X.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure seemed to misinterpret me. <br />
								&ldquo;If you say you can&rsquo;t, that just makes me want it more.&rdquo; <br />
								I tried again, pointing at my lips. <br />
								<br />
								Eventually, I struggled to type it out on my phone, explaining what had happened earlier. <br />
								But Azure kept nodding and going &ldquo;okay&rdquo; while reading it, ultimately falling sound asleep on my bed. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Listening to Azure sleep made me sleepy too, so I went to sleep on the sofa. <br />
								<br />
								When I woke up, I felt considerably better. <br />
								I tried a tongue twister. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;She sells sea sells by the sea shore, she sells sea sells by the sea shore&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								I seemed to be able to talk clearly enough. <br />
								Azure was sleeping with her belly button out. <br />
								I got a cold beer from the refrigerator and pressed it to her cheeks. <br />
								&ldquo;Brrr&#8230;&rdquo; Azure woke up. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;How long are you going to be borrowing the bed?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Claude, he speaks!&rdquo; Azure rejoiced. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You should get going soon,&rdquo; I said, drinking my beer. <br />
								Azure sleepily said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna,&rdquo; then looked at the clock and went &ldquo;Yikes!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure laid on the bed in silence for a while. <br />
								She seemed to be thinking about things. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure sat up on the bed and said: <br />
								&ldquo;Um&#8230; Sorry for being clingy earlier.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Oh, so you remember.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. Good thing I didn&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; <br />
								Azure tumbled onto her side in the same sitting position. <br />
								&ldquo;I want beer too, Mr. Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Get going already. Time&rsquo;s a-wasting.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You mean time to get wasted,&rdquo; Azure said, and laughed to herself. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Still, I give up&#8230;&rdquo; I said. <br />
								&ldquo;You end up liking being pestered, and then not pestering you ends up being the same thing. <br />
								So either way, I end up making you happy.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Could you not overthink it and just pester me?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; I said, putting one arm under Azure&rsquo;s knees and one behind her neck. <br />
								I lifted her up and carried her to the hallway. <br />
								I was surprised by her lightness. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I took her to the door, opened it, and stepped outside. <br />
								&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Azure said. <br />
								I kept walking, though. <br />
								<br />
								Azure looked up at me. <br />
								&ldquo;I get you. So this is how you&rsquo;ll pester me.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;With humiliating treatment, yes.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So I guess you noticed the state of my legs?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You had your vocal chords, Claude, but my legs are super sore.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Meaning you resisted?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Right. Like we established, if I&rsquo;m going to be killed, it&rsquo;ll be by Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I suppose you know what I&rsquo;m going to say next?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&quot;Then I won&rsquo;t kill you,&rdquo; naturally. <br />
								So at the very least, I want to go away before you do.&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;I see. Well then, I won&rsquo;t let you die before me.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Alright then, I won&rsquo;t let Claude die before me!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								After that conversation, I felt embarrassed. <br />
								It felt like the two of us had made an eternal oath. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Of course, things never go exactly as you want them. <br />
								<br />
								We both knew it was just for peace of mind. <br />
								With our experience, we knew death wasn&rsquo;t a gentle or pretty thing. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The next day, I was going to invite Azure to the usual park. <br />
								But I realized I&rsquo;d lost the ability to take over people&rsquo;s bodies. <br />
								<br />
								However, Azure did end up coming to the park. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d invite me, so I just came myself,&rdquo; Azure said triumphantly. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; I remarked, patting Azure&rsquo;s head. <br />
								<br />
								Azure pushed me away. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t treat me like a kid.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I guess you want to die just as much as usual.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, even when I&rsquo;m all prepared to die, suddenly I have a happy thought. <br />
								And then all that preparation goes down the drain. <br />
								<br />
								On top of that, I&rsquo;m getting strangely emotional, I feel like. <br />
								If I&rsquo;m not careful, I might just be happy all of a sudden. <br />
								So I want to avoid getting sentimental.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Thus, I invited Azure on a sentimental journey. <br />
								Because I wanted to do whatever I could to make Azure sentimental. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure basked in the pleasant breeze from the car window, quietly singing something. <br />
								I wondered if she thought I couldn&rsquo;t hear it. <br />
								<br />
								It was a song I knew well, so I thought I might sing along as I drove, but I decided against it. <br />
								<br />
								I had been hoping to hear Azure sing, though. <br />
								Having two only hobbies, alcohol and music, it figured she would know how. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We ordered hot dogs and crepes at a food cart, and sat down to eat. <br />
								Half the paint had come off of the ancient, Coca-Cola-red bench. <br />
								<br />
								Azure took off her sandals and sat sideways, putting her legs on my lap. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a while now, but I don&rsquo;t know much of anything about you, Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Like, I like music, for example. <br />
								But you knew that already, right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah, I saw your music. Your taste isn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What an honor!&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;m just easy to please when it comes to music.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Er, so&#8230; Is there anything like that you like, Claude?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Do you mean something I really like? <br />
								Or just &quot;kind of&rdquo; like?&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;Really like,&rdquo; Azure said, understanding my intent and smiling complacently. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I like things that slowly revolve.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Hmm? Give me some examples.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels, music boxes, clocks, sunflowers&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;The earth? The moon? The sun?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. Sure. I like heavenly bodies.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Or me? Which do you like more?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Hm?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Slowly-revolving things or me.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;The former.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Well then, I present slowly-revolving me.&rdquo; <br />
								Azure stood up and began to leisurely spin. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								As stated, I do like slowly-revolving things. <br />
								That fondness combined with Azure made me feel unusually relaxed, but I didn&rsquo;t even notice. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be that effective&#8230;&rdquo; Azure remarked. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								While cooling ourselves off with some Pocari Sweat bought from a vending machine, Azure and I returned to the parking lot. <br />
								<br />
								I could see cumulonimbus clouds past the clear sky. <br />
								Cicadas stopped and buzzed in the trees. <br />
								I supposed we had the same remaining lifespan as they did. <br />
								<br />
								I smelled incense coming from a house somewhere. <br />
								Wind chimes played, and sunburnt children with fishing rods ran past. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Should we just run away?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to be running from that psychic force wherever we go?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it can&rsquo;t be easy for them if it&rsquo;s the other side of the planet, right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And then what would we do?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Settle down somewhere with a little brook. <br />
								&#8230;Or maybe we can be bank robbers?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And then you&rsquo;ll die after being shot 87 times?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. Let&rsquo;s be Bonnie Azure and Claude Clyde.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t sound very realistic.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I know. It was a joke.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I drove with no destination in mind. <br />
								We stopped at a CD store and Azure bought Rubber Soul, which we played on the car stereo. <br />
								<br />
								Upon getting onto a mountain trail, we encountered many sharp turns. <br />
								Azure fell over in her seat with a &ldquo;Waaah!&rdquo; on every left. <br />
								She&rsquo;d unfastened her seatbelt at some point. <br />
								<br />
								I later took a right turn by mistake, causing her to fall over toward the driver&rsquo;s seat. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Azure cut in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to say something selfish now.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed eight people by now, right? <br />
								Well, I regret it. <br />
								<br />
								Now that I really think about it, I don&rsquo;t know for sure what those people did wrong. <br />
								Even if they were bad people, I didn&rsquo;t have anything personal against them. <br />
								<br />
								Then why did I do those things? <br />
								If you were one of them, Claude, I think I would&rsquo;ve even killed you then. <br />
								Thinking about it that way, I&rsquo;ve done something truly terrible. <br />
								<br />
								&#8230;But, well, I&rsquo;ve secretly been pretty pleased with all the things that have happened since I stopped at nine. <br />
								And that&rsquo;s even taking into account what&rsquo;s to come.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Actually, about that&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								I told Azure about the theory I had thought of earlier. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Azure said. &ldquo;I was wondering about that myself. <br />
								Why did we just automatically have targets in mind?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ability that would be useful for all sorts of things. <br />
								Why should it be wasted on just killing specified targets?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. It&rsquo;s really weird when you think about it.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Azure said sharply, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the proof? How do we prove there&rsquo;s someone controlling us?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d say that, but there&rsquo;s no proof of our murders either. <br />
								Since we just convinced people it was a suicide, they could have been doing it of their own volition.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But most importantly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for whatever reason, you don&rsquo;t think you were killing people of your own will.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I killed eight people,&rdquo; Azure said. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Knives don&rsquo;t kill people. Knives are just tools you can use. <br />
								And in that same way, someone used Azure to kill those people.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Think about it this way,&rdquo; I continued. <br />
								&ldquo;Maybe in part, we should take some responsibility for killing those people. <br />
								<br />
								But what reason was there for those needless murders? <br />
								Our powers could be used for all kinds of personal benefit, so why didn&rsquo;t we do that? <br />
								<br />
								Maybe they were limiting our ability. <br />
								They made sure we don&rsquo;t do anything they don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hmm&#8230; If that&rsquo;s true, then I&rsquo;m glad, but&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								Azure&rsquo;s head dropped and she waited a short time. <br />
								&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m still just terrible. I mean, here I am thinking how lucky I was to meet you because I killed eight people.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right. You met me because you stopped at eight.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure gave a worried smile. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t say that for sure. <br />
								But I feel like I should bear the responsibility until we can be sure they were bad people.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some impressive dedication. <br />
								You&rsquo;re assuming you&rsquo;re a cold-hearted murderer until you know it was for a good reason?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Well, what else can I do?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Left,&rdquo; Azure suddenly said. <br />
								I noticed without being having to be told. <br />
								<br />
								I stopped the car and we got out. <br />
								Contrasting the blue sky and white clouds above, the ground was filled with yellows and greens. <br />
								Countless white windmills stood spinning in the breeze. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got sunflowers and windmills twirling&#8230; <br />
								A place practically made for Claude,&rdquo; Azure said, standing at my side. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I felt like I&rsquo;d seen the scene a long time ago. <br />
								A girl in uniform, a man in a suit, a mismatched pair standing in a sunflower field together. <br />
								<br />
								Of course, I hadn&rsquo;t really seen it. <br />
								Maybe it was simply due to how well the spectacle suited my tastes. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure counted on her fingers. <br />
								&ldquo;Umm, merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels, music boxes, clocks, sunflowers, heavenly bodies&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Then she looked toward me and said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, right?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I nodded. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Oh, and slowly-revolving me.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Right. Well, you don&rsquo;t need to be spinning, really.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure went stiff in front of me. <br />
								&ldquo;Ooh&#8230; Sneak attack.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That bothers you, does it?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It does. You&rsquo;re embarrassing me.&rdquo; <br />
								Azure seemed to think to herself, &ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t have to spin, huh&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sunflowers down. Let&rsquo;s go to the next one.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You want to visit all of them?&rdquo;, I asked. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yep. All the slowly-revolving things. <br />
								One by one, and watch them revolve.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								It did seem like an ideal way to pass the time. <br />
								&ldquo;Is that okay with you?&rdquo;, I inquired. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll have you see all the things you like, and get attached to all of them. <br />
								And then you can cry &quot;I don&rsquo;t wanna dieee!&rdquo; into me.&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								&quot;Gotcha.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I bumped into Azure teasingly. <br />
								&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s not the Claude I know. <br />
								Don&rsquo;t you always have the final say? <br />
								Can&rsquo;t you make me do what you want?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Nah. I&rsquo;ve lost those shady powers now. <br />
								I can&rsquo;t control you anymore, Azure. Thank goodness for that.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be a problem. At least, when it comes to me. <br />
								I&rsquo;ve gotten in the habit of doing what you say.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Spin.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure starting spinning around in place. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								After two hours, we arrived at a department store picked by Azure. <br />
								I was surprised the anachronism of a rooftop amusement park still existed. <br />
								The exterior was also castle-like and old-fashioned. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&quot;Still existed,&rdquo; you say? It&rsquo;s brand new, actually. <br />
								And anachronisms are cool sometimes. <br />
								I guess it might have been the latest fad.&ldquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure assured me there were lots of things there I liked. <br />
								<br />
								We parked in the underground parking lot and went inside. <br />
								The ceiling was incredibly high, and the cool air was intense. <br />
								I felt like I had been shrunk. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We came across a store with a pleasant atmosphere. <br />
								Azure left me and went inside, but I went after her. <br />
								<br />
								&quot;Go look in a Melonbooks or something, Claude.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure wanted to do her own things, it seemed. <br />
								So I wandered around. <br />
								<br />
								I hadn&rsquo;t been to a department store in a long time. <br />
								As a result, I felt like some of my childhood memories were still around. <br />
								Of course, it&rsquo;s not as if I&rsquo;d ever visited this place. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I sat on a bench near the entrance and waited for Azure. <br />
								Everyone coming and going looked happy. <br />
								In fact, anyone who came here would have to have some degree of affluence. <br />
								They would have to be people with money to spend on &ldquo;wants.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Many guests came with their children, and they all looked like they came out of storybooks. <br />
								They had fine clothes, well-kept faces, pretty builds. <br />
								<br />
								I thought about their futures, and how they compared to my own. <br />
								I sighed. I was only discouraging myself. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Azure was soon standing beside me. <br />
								&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she said. <br />
								I didn&rsquo;t ask what she&rsquo;d been doing. <br />
								<br />
								The elevator looked crowded. <br />
								We rode an escalator, far longer than the ones I was used to seeing. <br />
								Azure pointed out the instructions on the wall. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hold hands inside the yellow lines, it says.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hold hands with your kids, it means.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Close enough. I&rsquo;m younger than you. <br />
								Look, we&rsquo;re inside the lines!&rdquo; Azure held out her hand. <br />
								<br />
								I softly held her thin white fingers. <br />
								Azure gripped tightly back. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Makes it seem like we&rsquo;re lovers.&rdquo; Azure looked up at me with a smile. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What, just because of this? More like we&rsquo;re brother and sister, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Is that how it looks to an observer, I wonder?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yep. Definitely a friendly brother and sister.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Even if I do this?&rdquo; Azure re-grabbed my hand, locking her fingers between mine. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hey now,&rdquo; I said. <br />
								Even so, I held her hand tight. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								When we arrived on the rooftop amusement park, loud music started to play. <br />
								It seemed to be coming from the clock tower up above. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mechanical clock,&rdquo; Azure said. <br />
								&ldquo;And here I thought I was the 100,000th visitor.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining,&rdquo; I said, holding out my hand. <br />
								It was only just drizzling, but I expected it would get heavier. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;So it is. Well, we better get on these quick,&rdquo; Azure said, pointing to the merry-go-round and Ferris wheel. <br />
								<br />
								Colorful lights reflected off the wet pavement. <br />
								As a result, the rooftop looked rather Christmas-y. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The merry-go-round wasn&rsquo;t a cheap childish thing like most, but designed rather elaborately. <br />
								<br />
								Just in case, I said: <br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine with just seeing them, actually. <br />
								I never said I really wanted to ride them.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								But Azure bought two tickets, and we were soon sitting in a carriage together. <br />
								The carriage started moving, and Azure spoke to me. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You know, you said you&rsquo;d kill me in some awful way&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah, I guess I did say that.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;What way would that be?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								I put some thought into my reply. <br />
								&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. First&#8230; I wouldn&rsquo;t kill you in a simple way. <br />
								I&rsquo;d make it take a lot of time, take it very slowly. <br />
								I&rsquo;d make sure you&rsquo;d have lots of regrets, get you attached to as many living things as possible. <br />
								You&rsquo;d be going on in that way for a long time.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Lots of time, huh? So then when would you kill me?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;It takes a while to get accustomed to happiness. <br />
								A decade, two decades. Could even be a century.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I take quite some time to kill, do I?&rdquo;, Azure remarked proudly. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								As I expected, the rain was getting more severe. <br />
								There were less and less people on the roof. <br />
								<br />
								We got on the Ferris wheel. <br />
								When it was at about half height, Azure said: <br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be killed over a century&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I was hoping for the same.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;But it sounds difficult.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;After all, we can&rsquo;t even be sure about tomorrow right now.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Is this something we can&rsquo;t escape from?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it too. <br />
								But I think they can do anything to us if they feel like it.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Hmm&#8230;&rdquo; Azure hung her head and pondered. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;How does this sound?&rdquo;, Azure said as the Ferris wheel approached two-thirds its maximum height. <br />
								&ldquo;Mr. Claude, please state the established procedure for driving a target to suicide.&rdquo;<br />
								<br />
								I went through the steps in my head. <br />
								<br />
								1. Take over the person&rsquo;s body. <br />
								2. Put on an appearance of sadness. <br />
								3. Make the surroundings tidy. (Most crucial step) <br />
								4. Write a note. <br />
								5. Die. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yes. And the first one being blocked is a problem. <br />
								But how about you do everything you can to get in the way of two, three, and four?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;For example, number two. <br />
								Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to make me so happy that there&rsquo;d be no reason to believe it was suicide?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Yeah. I feel like it&rsquo;s my duty to make it so nobody thinks it&rsquo;s a natural suicide.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Right. What&rsquo;s happiness for you, Claude?&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Times like now. Being with you, Azure.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure looked away shyly. <br />
								&ldquo;Umm&#8230; I mean, I&rsquo;m really happy to hear that, but don&rsquo;t be satisfied with just this. <br />
								There&rsquo;s still so much more to come, right? <br />
								I don&rsquo;t want to say something so tired, but I think life still has lots of fun things left.&rdquo;<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Our Ferris wheel reached its highest point. <br />
								We could see all the rain-drenched town from there. <br />
								<br />
								Azure said, clinging to the window and looking down: <br />
								&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;m going to the same college as you, Claude. <br />
								I&rsquo;ll study hard, and be your junior.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to try really hard,&rdquo; I smiled bitterly. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. You&rsquo;ll be teaching me, after all. <br />
								So we&rsquo;ll go to a cafe together again, and watch movies, and drink. <br />
								<br />
								Every year, we&rsquo;ll visit the graves of the people killed by us. <br />
								We won&rsquo;t live the greatest lives, but we&rsquo;ll live strong. <br />
								We&rsquo;ll live in a bright shadow. <br />
								<br />
								By that time, we&rsquo;ll stop talking the way we have been. <br />
								We&rsquo;ll talk honestly to each other about the past. For example -&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;For example, the fact that I desperately tried to keep myself from liking Azure, but it ended up being in vain.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure looked at me with wide, round eyes. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;, I emphasized. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;&#8230;Right. We&rsquo;ll talk about that kind of thing. <br />
								And how when we met after school, I would get my hair cut and dress nice, and I actually really enjoyed it.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And how when Azure suddenly showed up at my apartment, I felt incredibly relieved.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And how when you carried me because you were worried about my legs, I wished I could tell the whole world.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And how Azure was outrageously cute when she was drunk.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;And how when we kissed, I only pretended it was a mistake.&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								We returned to the store all wet, still laughing at each other. <br />
								<br />
								Thinking about it, this summer was constantly making Azure and I soaking wet. <br />
								And yet this was the first time it was from the rain. <br />
								<br />
								When we&rsquo;d finished off some warm coffee, music played through the store to indicate closing time. <br />
								<br />
								We stepped outside and walked through the rain without umbrellas. <br />
								Azure hummed to herself. <br />
								<br />
								A couple without a future, we would forever talk about happiness we were too late to have. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								The rain died down considerably. <br />
								Azure told me to look into the sky, and I could faintly see the moon. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t see the stars, but&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
								<br />
								Azure took something out of her bag. <br />
								I knew what it was before she could unpack it. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;A music box, of course.&rdquo; <br />
								Azure handed it to me. <br />
								A cylinder music box in the shape of a grand piano. <br />
								<br />
								&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve gathered everything you like, Claude. <br />
								Play the song,&rdquo; Azure told me. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								It was very sudden. <br />
								<br />
								While winding up the box, I suddenly felt the cloudiness in my heart cleared. <br />
								I escaped not the one trying to kill me, but a different, higher existence than that. I felt truly free. <br />
								<br />
								Instantly, my restrained and weakened feelings were liberated. <br />
								<br />
								The girl before my eyes suddenly seemed as if a god. <br />
								Thinking &ldquo;Ah, so she was,&rdquo; I embraced Azure without a word. <br />
								Azure yelped in surprise, but soon hugged me back. <br />
								<br />
								Of course, I thought. <br />
								It was only natural to be so full of feeling. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Some way or another, I would free Azure from this terrible cycle. <br />
								<br />
								We wouldn&rsquo;t cling onto this abject dead-end happiness, but truly smile from the bottom of our hearts. <br />
								<br />
								By the time the music box concluded its song, that was what I had decided. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								But as it turned out, that was the final day for us.<br />
